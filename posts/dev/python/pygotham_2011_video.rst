Carl put up a `Pledgie campaign`_ for raising $4,600 to cover the costs
for videoing `PyGotham 2011`_.

For $4,600, we're getting a lot of bang for our buck.  Amongst other things:

* video that will last long after the conference done by a seasoned video 
  crew that does video for PyCon, DjangoCon, and other conferences
* transcriptions of select talks

PyGotham 2011 is only a couple of weeks away.  They have a `pretty great
speaker line-up`_.  My manager is going to talk about Moving Fast with Django
covering deployment pipelines!

Your help funding video for this conference makes a big
difference!  `Please donate`_!
