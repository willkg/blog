I work for `PCF <http://pculture.org>`_
as a developer on the `Miro <http://getmiro.com/>`_ internet video
player.

Today we released `Miro 1.0 <http://www.getmiro.com/blog/2007/11/miro-10-is-here/>`_.
For most of the projects I've worked on, the 1.0 mark is exciting to reach,
but also somewhat of a downer because it really requires you to hone the list
of all possible things you could do down to a small finite list.  Inevitably,
there are things people will want to do that 1.0 doesn't do.  Still, it's a 
huge milestone for the project.  We're already working on post-1.0 development
and making changes to decisions that didn't turn out as well as we had hoped.

A good portion of the work we do is in Python with lots of interaction
between Python and libraries written in C and C++.  For example, we use a lot 
of `Pyrex <http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python/Pyrex/>`_
to speed up critical sections.

Miro is a great product to continue to push open standards for video 
distribution and consumption on the Internet.  I regularly watch GoogleEDU 
videos through Miro and I'm hoping other Python-related channels will be 
available as well.  At some point, I'd like to create my own Python-videos
channel and aggregate good Python-related video content.  There's a lot of
screencasts and tutorials out there....
