A few days ago, I saw on 
`Grig's blog <http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/>`_ that
`Titus created a mailing list covering Testing in Python <http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2007/02/testing-in-python-mailing-list.html>`_.
I joined the list and it's been very educational.  So far the posts
have been of the form:

   Hi--my name is _____________ (name) and I use 
   ______________ (framework) and ___________ (framework) and ____________
   (explanation for which framework gets used for which specific purposes).

Then this spawns a conversation with thoughts and insights and lots of
applause.  There have also been questions regarding how to use some
of the frameworks and which framework would suit some need the best.

While I'm following the mailing list, I'm taking notes so that I can finish up
this round of adding testing to PyBlosxom so that I can do a release this week.
We're using `nose <http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/>`_ and
I'm using a similar structure that `Cheesecake <http://pycheesecake.org/>`_
uses since I have some familiarity with their project.

It's a neat list so far.  I'm glad `Titus
<http://www.advogato.org/person/titus/>`_ put it together--it's definitely
solving my immediate needs.
