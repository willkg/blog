I'm really late to the PyPI party.  Both of the projects I've worked
on over the years are in PyPI, but neither are up to date and neither
support ``easy_install``.

Figured I'd update them now.  Three things I bumped into while working
on Lyntin:

1. the `PyPI tutorial <http://wiki.python.org/moin/CheeseShopTutorial>`_
   is good and walks you through what you need to know,
2. the `list of classifiers <http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers>`, and
3. the `Cheesecake <http://www.pycheesecake.org/>`_ folks have
   `scores for all the PyPi modules <http://pypi.pycheesecake.org/pypi/scores>`_

That last one is kind of interesting.  You can see the scores and the
Cheesecake log output.
