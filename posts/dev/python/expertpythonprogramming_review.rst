The story
=========

I, too, was contacted by Packt Press to review `Export Python Programming
<http://www.packtpub.com/expert-python-programming/book>`_
by Tarek Ziad√©.  I finished reading the book
months ago, but didn't get around to writing the review.

Then I saw the `review from some person I don't know <http://techblog.ironfroggy.com/2008/11/how-to-be-dissappointed-in-something.html>`_ and the `reply from Tarek <http://tarekziade.wordpress.com/2008/11/22/how-to-be-disappointed-with-the-printed-in-printed-book/>`_.

Tarek then went on to work through all the "bugs" and put out a new revision of
the book.  I still didn't get around to writing a review.


Then I saw `Orestis' review <http://orestis.gr/blog/2009/01/23/book-review-expert-python-programming/>`_.
This review is pretty comprehensive.  I think it covers a lot of the
things I was going to say, so I'll just fill in the gaps.


My short review
===============


The book is pretty good.  It's really aggressive in that it's trying to
cover a lot of ground and as such some of the chapters don't get very
deep.  Even so, I think the book does achieve it's mission:

* it tells Python developers who are unaware of tools that would help
  them do development in Python what they're missing,
* it tells them what tools and other things in the Python world fill
  those gaps,
* it walks through how to use those things (generally speaking)


There are two things I wish had been different.  The first is that
every chapter should have ended with a "further reading" section that
listed books, magazine articles, urls and other resources that further
cover the topic.  That would have really helped people the book is
targeting.


The other thing I wish had been different is that many of the urls used
throughout the book are "fragile": they're really long, have a lot of
funky bits in them, and if the owner of that site moves anything around,
the url becomes a dead link.  I'm not really sure how to fix this, but
maybe books should have bit.ly-like links in them that redirect through
the book's web-site to the url in question.  When the resource at that url
goes away, then the book author can change the web-site to summarize what 
was there or provide a different link.


If you're interested in the book
================================

If you think that's interesting, check out the
`Tarek's blog entry about the book and sample chapter <http://tarekziade.wordpress.com/2008/09/24/expert-python-programming-book-more-details-sample-chapter/>`_.


If you still like it, then it's probably worth buying or waiting for Packt
Press to send you an email to review it.  ;)

**Update January 18th, 2021** I wrote this a long time ago. Since then, Tarek
and I became co-workers and friends. I also did the tech review for his book
Python Microservices Development.
