I read the news of Guido van Rossum announcing his retirement as BDFL of
Python and it made me a bit sad.

I've been programming in Python for almost 20 years on a myriad of open
source projects, tools for personal use, and work. I helped out with
several PyCon US conferences and attended several others. I met a lot
of amazing people who have influenced me as a person and as a programmer.

I started `PyVideo <https://pyvideo.org>`_ in March 2012. At a PyCon US
after that (maybe 2015?), I found myself in an elevator with Guido and
somehow we got to talking about PyVideo and he asked point-blank, "Why
work on that?" I tried to explain what I was trying to do with it: 
create an index of conference videos across video sites, improve the meta-data,
transcriptions, subtitles, feeds, etc. I remember he patiently listened to me
and then said something along the lines of how it was a good thing to
work on. I really appreciated that moment of validation. I think about it
periodically.  It was one of the reasons Sheila and I worked hard to
transition PyVideo to a new group after we were burned out.

It wouldn't be an overstatement to say that through programming in Python,
I've done some good things and become a better person.

Thank you, Guido, for everything!
