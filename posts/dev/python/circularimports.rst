I keep bumping into circular import problems.  While some say it's a symptom of
bad design, I'm not wholly sure I agree.  Some systems are just really complex.
Not everything can be refactored into a pretty little UML diagram.

Anyhow, there's a link on `daily python url
<http://www.pythonware.com/daily/index.htm>`_ to `Victor Ng's blog entry
<http://www.crankycoder.com/archives/000169.html>`_ on his experience with
circular import problems with Python.  The comments of that blog entry are
wonderfully enlightening.
