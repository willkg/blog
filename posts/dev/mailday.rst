So I have this program that I wrote in C and then re-wrote in Perl
that I've been running for some time.  I just re-wrote it in Python.
I feel kind of funny re-writing the same thing over and over again
in my new favorite language, but the issue is that I've forgotten
large portions of the old favorite languages and it takes a while for
me to remember how to do things so I can fix new issues I've found.
