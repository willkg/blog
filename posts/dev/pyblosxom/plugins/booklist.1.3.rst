I was poking through other peoples' blogs and bumped into one that
mentioned a bunch of things I should do to my booklist plugin to fix
it.  One of which involved switching it from hard-coded html to use
pyblosxom flavours.  So I did that work and some other neatening
up and released it.  Get it on my 
`pyblosxom page </~willkg/dev/pyblosxom/>`_.
