I decided the registry plugin needed to allow users to see all
the pending submissions and details therein.  So I made
some changes:

* added handling of /registry_queue which shows all the pending
  submissions.
* added some code to displaying of the entry so that the "edit"
  link doesn't appear if there's already a pending change.

Get it on my `pyblosxom page </~willkg/dev/pyblosxom/>`_.
