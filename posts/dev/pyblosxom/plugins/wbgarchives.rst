I've blogged for so many months now that the Archives listing on the
side was getting pretty long.  I don't really want a long list
of months and years there, so I was looking for options.

`Ned Batchelder <http://www.nedbatchelder.com/blog/index.html>`_
lists his archives by year.  For each year, there's a summary page
by month which lists the dates and titles of all blog entries for
that month.  I really liked this idea, so I wrote my own archives
plugin to use it.  It's not exactly the same--the output is slightly
different.  It's good enough for me, though.
