Prior to today, I was maintaining all my PyBlosxom plugins by
hand which was kind of silly, but I hadn't really gotten around
to investigating better solutions.

However, that day has come!  I've pulled them all into a CVS repository
and set up CVSTrac to manage documentation, bugs, features, and allow
people to see version history for all of them.  I'm in the process of
going through all the plugins, adding CVS tags, updating copyright
dates, fixing documentation, adding notes in regards to where the
plugin is maintained and all that.  

I aim to make the end result more organized for me and users looking 
for plugins and also require less effort to maintain.
