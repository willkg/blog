I was talking with Josh the other day and he told me that I should take the
time to learn Subversion and switch over rather than investing more time to
tame my projects with CVS and CVSTrac.  So I spent a good portion of today
moving my PyBlosxom plugins (the ones that I wrote and/or maintain on my own)
to a Subversion repository and Trac.

There are a couple of things that will take getting used to, but overall I've
been able to replicate everything I did with CVS in Subversion.

I'm still making modifications to the setup, but I'll be hosting all my PyBlosxom
plugins work at 
`<http://www.bluesock.org/~willg/cgi-bin/pybltrac.cgi/>`_.
I've allowed anonymous ticket creation for feature requests, bug reports, and the
like.  If you're sitting on issues, patches, and things of that nature, feel free
to submit them.
