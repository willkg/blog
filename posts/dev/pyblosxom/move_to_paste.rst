I've been following (very loosely) `Ian Bicking's <http://blog.ianbicking.org/>`_
`paste <http://pythonpaste.org/>`_
progress and it's really amazing stuff.  Today, I bumped into his
screencast on `Ajaxy exception catching <http://blog.ianbicking.org/ajaxy-exception-catching.html>`_.
That was really cool and I could see how
it could be immensely helpful with debugging/fixing PyBlosxom plugins.

I'm adding "investigate porting PyBlosxom to paste" to my todo list for
winter break; paste looks seriously awesome.
