I'm testing out gnome-blog.... Not entirely sure what all these things
do....

I'll post this entry and see if it does what I'm hoping it'll do.

**Update:**

It sort of did what I expected. Gnome-blog seems to wrap everything in <p>
stuff. It seems it handles the html for you which is nice, I guess. I had to go
in manually and edit the resulting blog entry, though.
