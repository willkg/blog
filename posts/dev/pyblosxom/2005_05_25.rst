I'm going to try to fix a couple of issues before releasing
PyBlosxom 1.2.1 and contributed plugins pack 1.2.2.  The issues
are as follows:

* w3cdate plugin doesn't expand "w3cdate" variable in head or foot 
  templates
  `(w3cdate variable details) <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.pyblosxom.user/1170>`_
* comments plugin borks in unusual circumstances
  `(comments borks details) <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.pyblosxom.user/1169>`_
* comments plugin requires the email field
  `(comments email field) <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.pyblosxom.user/1157>`_

I'm working on PyBlosxom Manual changes as well.  I think it's good to add
a chapter on comments and I need to flesh out the chapter on syndication, too.
If anyone wants to help with the PyBlosxom Manual, let me know--I'm happy
to pass off some of the writing/collection/verification work to other people.

If you find any problems with PyBlosxom 1.2 or the contributed plugins pack--let
me know those issues as well.
