I'm almost done the next version of the PyBlosxom manual.  At the suggestion
of Steven, I converted the manual thus far from html to docbook.  I still
need to do a lot of work in terms of indexing and adding warnings and notes
and various other indicators like that.  I'm busy re-writing chapters to
reflect issues people are having on the pyblosxom-users list.

I think I've worked between 20 and 30 hours on it over the last week 
and a half--it's almost like another part time job.
