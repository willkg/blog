Wow!  `Martin <http://blog.madduck.net/>`_ wrote up a howto for installing
PyBlosxom on Debian for multiple people.  

There's a series of things here I don't really know about (e.g.  what kinds of
things should go in /srv?).  At some point, I'd like to fix PyBlosxom so it's
more "standard" in terms of installation and configuration for web
applications.

Here's the link for `configs/pyblosxom <http://kindergarten.madduck.net/configs/pyblosxom>`_
which walks through installing a single software installation on Debian
for multiple people.
