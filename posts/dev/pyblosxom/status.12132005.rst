I re-wrote ``blosxom_path_info_handler`` and cleaned it up a lot.
The adjustments also allow people to create categories that look
like dates (and previously would get interpreted as dates and
screw things up).

I'm going through the documentation, the bug list, and a couple
of other changes I want to make.  I'll also tackle any low-hanging
fruit that's on my todo list.  Otherwise, I consider PyBlosxom
1.3 pretty complete.  If all goes as I plan, it'll be out before
Christmas in some form.
