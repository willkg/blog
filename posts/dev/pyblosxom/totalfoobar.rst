I decided to release my old set of flavour templates on the
`flavour registry <http://www.planetpyblosxom.org/blog/registry/flavours/>`_
and in so doing totally foobarred all the times on all the files of
my blog.  I recovered most of them (because I have a mirror that's
usually off by a few days), but then I had to guess on the times
for the latest four entries.

So that sucked.  Given what I just went through, I'm beginning to
think it's a terrible idea to use the timestamp on the file as the
mtime.  Blech.
