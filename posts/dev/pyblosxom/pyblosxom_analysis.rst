There are a few people doing analysis on the ``tools.Walk`` chain with
the hope of slimming it down because it's one of the corner issues
with PyBlosxom scaling up to thousands of entries.  I don't really
have time today to look at them (I'm at work right now), but I will
(hopefully) soon and hopefully this spawns a discussion that results
in better PyBlosxom code.
