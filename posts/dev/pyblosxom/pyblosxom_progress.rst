There's been a flurry of email on the PyBlosxom mailing lists over
the last month.  I'm totally buried at the moment, so I haven't
had time to go through them and figure out what it all means in the
grand scheme of things.

I updated the 
`todo list <http://wiki.subtlehints.net/moin/PyBlosxomToDo>`_
with everything in my head right now (though I'm sure there's other
things floating around that aren't on that page).

Robert Wall is 
`working on doing analysis <http://robwall.com/article/28/work-on-pyblosxom>`_
on PyBlosxom and coming up with some code to fix
issues he's uncovering.

Hopefully, his work and the work of others will result in some big fixes
to PyBlosxom that will (hopefully) simplify the architecture, reduce
the number of performance issues, and open up more possibilities.

I also finished up work on `Planet PyBlosxom <http://www.planetpyblosxom.org/>`_
which I had been threatening to do for a while now.

Lots of progress, though.  I wish I had more free time to help grease
the skids a bit.
