We've cleaned up a lot code and documentation and fixed a lot of bugs.
We've stabilized the API and added static rendering.  In short, this
should be a pretty solid 1.0 milestone for PyBlosxom.

I encourage people to upgrade.  When you untar the distribution tarball,
read through INSTALL and README.  These files will walk you through
installation and upgrading from 0.9.

Personally, I'm glad we finally pushed out 1.0.  I'm not sure it's a 
perfect release, but it's good enough for a 1.0 milestone and I feel
good about releasing it at this point.  It's hard to push a project
through to a release when there's not much feedback from testing and
usage of previous alphas and release candidates.  I think at some point
you just have to bite the bullet and push it out and see how it does.

Cheers to the PyBlosxom development crew!
