I finally got around to releasing PyBlosxom 1.1.  The big change is that I'm
only planning to work on and maintain the core--I'm hoping someone will come
along and pick up maintenance for all the contributed plugins.  I haven't
figured out what the contingency plan will be.  I might maintain that too,
but whine about it very loudly until someone gets tired of me whining.
I'm also slowly getting through working on the documentation.  I noticed
that `the wiki <http://wiki.subtlehints.net/moin/PyBlosxom>`_ that
I'm basing a portion of my documentation on disappears every now and then.
So...  I'm thinking that's a good sign that I should finish up quickly.

George called me up and offered to take Planet PyBlosxom off my hands.  I
want to pass off all the little things to other people in the PyBlosxom
community so that:

* I have more time to focus on PyBlosxom core
* Other people are involved in the community--more people -> more ideas 
  -> better community
* Minimize the significance of me in the PyBlosxom world

In the meantime, I'm working on finishing reading 
`Dive into Python <http://diveintopython.net/>`_.
It's one of those books I wished I had read years ago.  I got a hard-copy
from my parents for Christmas.  I've put a halt on coding until I'm done.
