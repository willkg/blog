I think I may release 1.0.1 this weekend depending on what else is going
on life-wise. I tossed a feeler email out to the dev list in regards to
what else should be fixed for 1.0.1, but didn't get anything back--which
isn't surprising as people are pretty busy these days.

So... to do a release or not--that is the question. Is there anyone
reading this blog who has things that they'd like to see for a very
minor fix-it point release that's doable by one man who only has a bit
of free time (unless they're interested in sending in a patch)?
