Many apologies for the length of time that this has taken me to complete.

Changes:

* Overhauled the flavour template finding system allowing people to
  more easily build, trade, and install "flavour packs"
* Added a built-in Atom 1.0 flavour and an RSS 2.0 flavour
* New logging system making it easier to track down PyBlosxom issues
  and plugin issues
* Documentation comes in the .tar.gz file, though it's in docbook format
* Some other bug fixes here and there

Plugins that work for PyBlosxom 1.2 should continue to work with 1.3.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with it.  It's not everything I originally
set out to do, but it's a good amount of work for a release.  Many
many thanks to everyone who helped out.

You can download it from the 
`PyBlosxom website <http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/>`_.
