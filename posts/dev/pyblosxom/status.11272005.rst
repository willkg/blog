The code seems to be working nicely so far. There's one piece I still
want to code before a PyBlosxom 1.3 rc release. I still have to go
through the manual, update the content, and do some more work on
organization. It's likely I won't get to work on it until the end of the
semester, so that puts the next release some time at the end of
December.
