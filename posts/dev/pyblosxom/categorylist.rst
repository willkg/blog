So, I was looking around in the wide wide world of blogging and saw a
bunch of sites that list the categories they have on the side along with
their archives and calendars and all kinds of fancy things... And I
wanted one too!

I took a gander at the ``pyarchives.py`` plugin and then cannabalized it
into ``pycategories.py`` which returns that fancy list of category links
you see on the far right under the calendar.

Then like a good boy, I added it to the CVS repository figuring it's
probably going to be a must-have feature rather than an eclectic feature
that only a few of us real blogging odd-balls would want.
