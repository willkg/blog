Blake poked me via email and suggested I put together some ideas
for a PyBlosxom GSoC project under the PSF umbrella a couple of months 
ago.  It was a hectic time, but I threw some ideas together based on 
items we had in the TODO list (many of which are pretty stale at this 
point).  I'm happy to say that we had a great proposal for building
a web front end for PyBlosxom--a tool that I think a good portion of
PyBlosxom users would be happy to have.

I'll be mentoring this project over the course of the summer.  Z has
already started working on things and I think this will turn out nicely.

As a side note, this is a huge motivator towards finishing up a release
and getting out a new version of the PyBlosxom manual.  On the flip side,
I'm getting married in a week so I'm finding it difficult to allocate
time to get the work done.  Wedding planning is intense.  They should 
use wedding planning to teach project management courses--talk about
shifting requirements and general project shenanigans.
