I mentored Z who was working on 
`pyblosxom-webfront <http://code.google.com/p/pyblosxom-webfront/>`_
which is a web-based interface to your PyBlosxom blog.

Overall I'm pretty happy with the project.  I had a pretty chaotic May and June
that definitely affected the first half of the project, but Z and I had
a few chats just before the second half and ironed most of the issues out.

While he was working on webfront, I rolled out PyBlosxom 1.4 (and 1.4.1 and
1.4.2) which have support for Paste.  Paste makes writing plugins and
testing them _so_ much easier.  Z also worked out some problems with
making complex plugins.  We should look into refactoring the comments 
plugin accordingly.

From here Z says he'd like to continue working on webfront and maintaining
it.  There are a bunch of things that it's missing, but it's a good platform
to build on and it was a good experience to work with him to get there.

Thank you Google!
