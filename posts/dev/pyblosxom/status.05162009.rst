I finished up some additional work and I'm at a testing stage for
PyBlosxom.  I want to do some more testing and some documentation
then it'll be ready for testing releases.

Also, I spent a couple of minutes upgrading my blog to use 1.5
in trunk.  Bumped into bunch of weird issues with the comments
plugin, but otherwise it was really smooth.
