I'm in the process of passing off maintenance to a few people who
expressed interest on the pyblosxom-devel mailing list. Towards
that goal, I've moved pyblosxom to a new github repository under
the pyblosxom organization. Thus it's now at:

https://github.com/pyblosxom/pyblosxom

I then forked it, so you can continue looking at my fork if you so
desire, but I probably won't be doing anything with it going forward.
