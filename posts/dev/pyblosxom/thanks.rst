I didn't expect either of 
:doc:`What to do with pyblosxom <whattodo>` and
:doc:`Busy busy busy <busybusybusy>`
to drum up the response they did.  I've gotten emails and comments from
both entries that were way cool.

As a result, I've finally gotten around to building the flavour registry,
I decided I'm going to see what's up and whether I'll work through a 1.1
release for PyBlosxom.  We're working through what to do in regards to
the filestat callback and possibly moving caching.  I started investigating
what would be involved in building a regression testing framework (which
would double as a performance testing framework as well).

It's been a good couple of days.  I really appreciate the advice and 
encouragement I've gotten.  Thanks!
