My blog has been going up and down a lot over the last few days
as I'm getting the kinks out of some code I re-wrote in PyBlosxom
and searching for other issues.  I've successfully transitioned
to the new included RSS 2.0 feed without disturbing any of the planets
that I'm on.  Things are looking good so far.  Release soon!
