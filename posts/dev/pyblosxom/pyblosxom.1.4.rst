It's been 17 months or so since the last PyBlosxom release which for
a small project is probably too long a period of time.  Real life is
a tough sometimes.

Changes:

* bunch of bug-fixes
* converted the documentation from docbook to restructured text
* updates to the documentation
* code overhaul
* added the beginnings of unit/functional testing using nose
* better WSGI support
* Paste support

w00t!
