We're almost done with 0.9 and the code is baking in CVS and Ted
is doing interesting and exciting things with metaweblog, comments, and
his Lucene search plugins.  When that all gets sorted out, then
we'll do a release which has been a long time coming.

In the meantime, if you want to try out what's in CVS, 
`here is a snapshot as of February 24, 2004 </~willkg/dev/pyblosxom/pyblosxom-cvs-02242004.tar.gz>`_.
Setup is just like
PyBlosxom 0.8.1.  Features for users are pretty much the same.
Biggest changes are architectural which will enable plugins to
solve a very wide variety of problems and do all kinds of exciting
stuff.

Official announcements and all that on the PyBlosxom site soon.
Additionally, I've been working on 
`Planet PyBlosxom </~willkg/planetpyblosxom/>`_, which
will provide a centralized newsfeed of PyBlosxom stuff from 
PyBlosxom users' web-sites via their RSS feeds.
