I got a few comments from people who were interested in how I used `Cheesecake
<http://pycheesecake.org/>`_ to clean up `PyBlosxom
<http://pyblosxom.sf.net/>`_.  I tossed around making it a series of blog
entries but then decided to write it up as a technical article: `Cleaning up
PyBlosxom using Cheesecake
<http://www.bluesock.org/~willkg/cgi-bin/pybltrac.cgi/wiki/CleaningUpPyBlosxom>`_.

I think it came out nicely, though parts of it are too "wordy".  I really liked
writing the article using Trac's wiki system.  My only problem with Trac's wiki
system is that the documentation for writing wiki macros needs a lot of help.

I'm going to update some of the PyBlosxom plugin writing tutorials I wrote a
couple of years ago and put them in my trac instance, too.  I still have work
to do with PyBlosxom, but it's coming along very nicely.  I'm working on unit
tests and functional tests now.

**Updates:**

May 11th, 2017: The pycheesecake and my Trac sites are now gone. You can find
my article :doc:`here <cleaningitup>`.
