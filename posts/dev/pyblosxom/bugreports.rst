I've noticed while working on PyBlosxom that bugs can literally be
reported anywhere. Not only that, but people get annoyed (really
annoyed) when you don't respond to their bug report which was reported
using a method that I never would have dreamed of. We've had reports in
all the following places:

* on the pyblosxom-users mailing list (I prefer this one)
* on the pyblosxom-devel mailing list (this one is great too)
* in a comment on the PyBlosxom main site for an article that has to do
  with a release
* in a comment on the PyBlosxom main site for an article that has
  nothing to do with a release
* in a comment on some other site (mine, Planet PyBlosxom, ...) in an
  article that has nothing to do with a release
* in a blog entry on someone else's site--someone I've never previously
  had contact with and whose blog isn't connected to anyone else's blog
* in the PyBlosxom documentation wiki
* in some other wiki that I've never previously seen
* on IRC in the #pybloscom channel (these are cool, but I'll never hear
  about the bug unless I'm specifically online which is not usually the
  case)
* sent in email to me or someone else
* added to the bug tracker on our SourceForge site

It takes a huge amount of time to check all these places--many of which
come and go. It really puzzles me why people don't try to be more social
and send bug reports via channels that other projects typically use (bug
trackers, mailing lists, and IRC). I've been trying to coerce people
into a few standard channels, but it's really hard on a project like
this and there's a lot of resistance.

Bottom line is that this kind of thing really affects the project's
quality. There are bugs out there that I will never trip over that
someone else did but because they chose to whisper it into their pillow
at night rather than tell someone about it, the bug won't get fixed and
will trip someone else up.

I thought blogs were supposed to be social tools to enhance communities
and promote discussion.

Anyhow, we can only do the best that we can do.
