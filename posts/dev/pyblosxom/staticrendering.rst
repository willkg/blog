I hacked for 3 or 4 hours on static rendering today.  Almost have
it complete where "complete" is defined as "statically renders
your basic blog into html and other flavour forms" and is not
defined as "handles dynamic content, comments, and other neat
things seamlessly".

I think that'll all be in version 2.

In the process of implementing what I implemented, I moved some
stuff around, cleaned up the common_start stuff, re-tested xmlrpc,
removed some old files in the CVS repository, and fixed some bugs
that had been lying around undiscovered.

Assuming I get some time tomorrow to work on it, I'll have static
rendering finished before the end of the weekend.
