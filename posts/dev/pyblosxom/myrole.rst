I plain ran out of time and energy to work on PyBlosxom, so I stepped
down as maintainer. I'll stay on the project as an occasional developer.

I went through my plugins and discovered wbgpager had a bug in it that
prevented it from working with PyBlosxom 1.2. So I fixed it and released
wbgpager 1.2. You can find it
`here </~willkg/dev/pyblosxom/>`__ with all the
other plugins I've done. I also made some fixes to some of the other
plugins. So if you're using anything I wrote, you might want to check to
see if there are new versions.
