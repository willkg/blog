Someone posted my article `Cleaning Up PyBlosxom Using
Cheesecake <http://bluesock.org/%7Ewillkg/cgi-bin/pybltrac.cgi/wiki/CleaningUpPyBlosxom>`__
onto `programming.reddit <http://programming.reddit.com/>`__ which was a
bit of a surprise to me.

I'll keep track of the entry and the comments that it generates in case
there's any feedback that would be useful for making the article better.
