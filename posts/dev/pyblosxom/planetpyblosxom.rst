Got the notice from Network Solutions today stating that unless I renew right
this second, the domain name is free again for anyone's taking.

I had worked with George to get Planet PyBlosxom up and running, but he seems
to have paged out and hasn't responded to the last few emails I've sent.

It was an interesting thing to run for a year.
