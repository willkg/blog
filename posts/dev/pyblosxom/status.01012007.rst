My semester break is drawing short and I didn't get much of what
I wanted to get done done.  I merged Lance's documentation fixes
in, I'm fiddling with a new pyblcmd script, and I'm cleaning
up things I started, but never finished.

Ryan is going hog-wild with getting the comments plugin to a better
place.

I was thinking of switching the web-site to use MediaWiki and in doing
so solve a bunch of issues we have, but I think I'm going to wait on
that for a while.  In the meantime, I do plan on doing a web-site update
and make it look more like some other Python-project web-sites.  In
the process of doing that, I think I may move it over to be statically
rendered.

That's it for this status report--trying to keep it short and sweet 
while getting across that some things are happening, but it's slow 
going.

Many thanks to `Lance <http://www.catprint.ca/blog/>`_ and 
`Ryan <http://snarfed.org/>`_ and all the other folks who
have been putting time and energy into PyBlosxom over the last
few months.  You guys rock!
