I applied a few patches that I've received over the last month or so.
I'll hopefully release the contributed plugins pack--there have been
a lot of updates since I last released it (ages and ages ago).

Next step is to fold some more documentation into the manual and
figure out to handle contributed plugins better.  Need to figure out
how to fix the problem that the ones I don't use on my blog are of
unknown quality and different versions of the different plugins work
with different version of PyBlosxom.  I'd also like to re-organize
the plugins into categories that make more sense.

At one point I was planning on building a page on the web-site tracking
things that need to be done for PyBlosxom.  Now I think I'll just put
the list in a TODO.txt file in Subversion along with everything else.
It occurs to me we probably had one at one point, but I probably deleted
it.
