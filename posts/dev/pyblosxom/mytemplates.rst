I've been asked a couple of times for the templates for the HTML flavour
of my blog. So `here is a tar.gz file of them and the
stylesheet </~willkg/dev/pyblosxom/my_templates.tar.gz>`__.

A warning to folks who download that file: the templates and stylesheet
aren't wildly pretty. I'm not a web-designer--I just pretend to be one.
