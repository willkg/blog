Theoretically, I just got w.bloggar working with my blog.  There were 
some minor fixes I had to do to the xmlrpc lib we have in PyBlosxom.  
I'll be checking these changes in.

Beyond that, I wanted to see what the tool actually did.  Where does 
it put the file?  What does the file look like?  What's the name of 
the file?  So on so forth....  Enquiring (or is it Inquiring) minds 
want to know!
