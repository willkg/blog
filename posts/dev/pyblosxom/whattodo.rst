`David Ascher <http://david.ascher.ca/>`_ started using 
PyBlosxom and there are a couple of other users who look like they're 
just starting to use it as well.  I think that's fantastic--especially 
given that the project is on life support right now.

Life support?  What makes me say that?  Well, I've been threatening to
do a 1.0.1 release for months but never did it.  Development has all
but stopped because there aren't any active developers.  Back when I
released 1.0, I told people I wasn't going to touch it for 6 months
because I was really burned out on this project and I had too many other
things going on.  So then nothing happened except a mild trickle on
the mailing lists.

I'm not sure what to do.  I can't really take on another project and
push it through the motions.  PyBlosxom has documentation, but it's
mediocre and has large gaps and it's spread across two sites one of
which I don't think most people get to.  The debian maintainer for
the PyBlosxom package needs help updating the package, but I don't
know enough about packages to help and haven't had the time to work
on it.  There has been some interest in a flavour registry, but it
seems that there's only interest from a "we want a flavour registry"
perspective and very very little to no interest from a "I'd like to
contribute to a flavour registry" perspective.  Blah blah blah.

There are a bunch of issues and no one to solve them.  I'm really
hesitant to throw my energy at this project again.  Part of me wonders
if I should just start solving some of the smaller problems that need
to get solved (lack of testing infrastructure, lack of centralized
documentation, ...) and then go from ther step by step.  Seems so
overwhelming.

Not to mention that my life is a mess right now--I'm still moving 
and I've got a list of promises I haven't fulfilled dating back
two or three years.  Then I got bitched out on one of the 
projects I work on for being an elitist egomaniac.  I just want to 
help identify and fix problems to make things better/easier/faster/more
useful.  Bummer.
