SourceForge [1]_ now has Subversion access to project stuff so I
migrated the CVS repository of all PyBlosxom things over to Subversion.
Then I tested it out to make sure it works. So far it seems much easier
to deal with in the grand scheme of things. I'll probably write more
when I find something to kvetch about. :)

.. [1] For some reason, I keep typing "SourceForget"--not sure why.
