I've been working on `Pyblosxom <https://pyblosxom.github.io/>`__
since January 9th, 2003. The initial commit from Wari is on November
24th, 2002. I discovered that (according to the commits), I was the
second person to commit to the codebase. I didn't know that.

In January of 2012, I started a hiatus from Pyblosxom. We had done a ton
of overhaul work for 1.4 and 1.5 and I was tired and wanted to work on
other things.

I've decided it's time to end my reign as maintainer of Pyblosxom.
I sent an email to the pyblosxom-devel list as such. Further, I contended
that maybe it's time for the project to end altogether.

Yes, I suggested maybe it's time to end the project. The reasons are
two-fold:

1. The code has a ton of technical debt. There are a lot of plugins
   that need a lot of help. There's a lot of squirrely code. I've done
   a poor job of fixing the "Where can I find plugins?" and "Where can
   I find pretty flavours?" problems. Those are big problems and potentially
   require a lot of maintenance.

2. It's really hard to fix architectural problems with Pyblosxom without
   changing the scope of the project. I contend it's way easier at this
   point to just start a new one.

Anyhow, I'm a little sad and I'll have to figure out what to do with my
blog, but I think it's been a long time coming and it feels good to put
it to rest.

So, two things:

1. If you're interested in maintaining Pyblosxom, hop on the pyblosxom-devel
   mailing list and say hi!

2. I cut a lot of my teeth on this project. Most of the current problems
   are my fault. If you're a current user of Pyblosxom, thank you for using
   something I spent a ton of time on and cared very much about and thank
   you for your patience as I figured a lot of things out.

On to new horizons!
