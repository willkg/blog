In lieu of other solutions, I'm going to start releasing contributed plugins
plugin packs.  This one should work with PyBlosxom 1.1.

If you find problems with contributed plugins, visit 
`this page on how to contact us <http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/blog/static/contact>`_
"Problems" could be bugs, feature-requests, or setup issues.

If this works out, then I'll continue releasing contributed plugin packs that
match up to PyBlosxom.

Find the contributed plugin pack `at contrib.1.1.tar.gz <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=67445&package_id=145140>`_.

**Updates:**

02/23/2005: Changed the url.  Decided to do an actual "release" and store 
it on the PyBlosxom site.
