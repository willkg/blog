This is the second release of the contributed plugins pack for PyBlosxom
1.2.  In terms of functionality, there were a bunch of fixes to the
comments and trackbacks components and I overhauled pycategories.  Beyond
that, there were a lot of license changes (or in most cases license
applications) and some documentation changes.  In general, this release
is a huge milestone for sorting out the big mess that was the contributed
plugins.

Bravo to Wari, Ted, Steven, Blake, Bill, and everyone else that was 
involved in pulling this together.
