I finally released the contributed plugins pack for PyBlosxom 1.3.  To
be honest, I really wanted to get around to testing everything more,
but it's a big project and I never made the time to do it.  Rather than
sitting on it forever, I decided to release it now.  It's vaguely
possible that someone out there will download it, discover that the
plugins they're interested in are terribly tested, and help fixing the
real problem which is that the only testing we do on the PyBlosxom
project is anecdotal testing ("well, it works for me...") by setting
up some kind of magical testing framework.
