I'm going to release the PyBlosxom contributed plugins pack 1.2.3
for PyBlosxom 1.2 in the next couple of days.  So if anyone is sitting
on any fixes that need to go on, let me know soon.

This has a few fixes here and there--some of which are cosmetic.
It also has a behavior fix for the comments plugin so that comments
are shown if you have ?showcomments=yes in the querystring as well
as when the specific story is viewed.
