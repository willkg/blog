While I was writing up the release blog post for pyblosxom 1.5, I figured out
that I've probably been working on Pyblosxom 1.5 on and off for the last
three years or so.  That's pretty intense---I knew I'd been working on
it for a while, but I didn't realize how long it actually was.

The last year or so of development has been fun.  There's a pretty
consistent contingent of friendly folks who hang out on ``#pyblosxom``.
I really appreciate their humoring me with my period, "Pyblosxom 1.5 is
almost done!  I just have to ..." announcements.

Details of the release are in ``the release blog post``.  If you've
been waiting to upgrade, this is a good version to upgrade to.

Going forward, I'm going to take a hiatus from Pyblosxom development.
I've got a bunch of other projects that I've been ignoring for a while
that really need some attention.  I'll continue to review patches, help
out on ``#pyblosxom`` and the mailing lists, and I'll push out future
releases, but I won't be doing any major development for a while.
