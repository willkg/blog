I'm releasing pyblosxom 1.0 RC1 right now.  I overhauled the callback 
documentation in the ReadMeForPlugins file and read through other 
documentation and I think we're good enough for a 1.0 release now.

The RC1 is at `<http://bluesock.org/~willkg/dev/pyblosxom/pyblosxom-1.0-RC1.tar.gz>`_.

Feel free to download it and test it out--it's very much like alpha1 with
a few differences:

* I threw in a logdir property into config.py and adjusted plugins 
  that use logfiles to use it
* Documentation fixes

That's about it, I think.

In the tar.gz file is an INSTALL file which details installing PyBlosxom.  
There is also a README which talks about differences between 0.9 and 
1.0 (which will help you upgrade an existing PyBlosxom installation).

Let me know what you think.  I plan on doing a 1.0 release in the next 
few days.  Probably Thursday.
