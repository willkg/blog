It's been a long time since the last status. PyBlosxom 2.0 had been
stagnating for a year and I decided to move it out of the way, put it
out of its misery, and start new progress with the PyBlosxom 1.4.3 tag.
I scaled back the vision and now I'm working on PyBlosxom 1.5.

I've pulled in some of the changes that were destined for 2.0 and added
some new ones:

* lots of code cleanup
* pyblosxom-cmd script that automates a whole bunch of things and gives
  plugins command-line abilities
* re-working the documentation using Sphinx
* doubling the number of unit tests
* fixing a lot of bugs

In the very near future, I plan to overhaul the website and fix project
infrastructure issues.

That's where things are. Hoping to have an April release of PyBlosxom
1.5.
