I thought `this article <http://www.dadgum.com/james/performance.html>`_

It's very often that I'll be working on a project and focusing on behavior
issues when someone will come along and tell me it's not optimized fully.
They're right in a sense, but I'm not sure that's important until I get the
behavior right.  It's not as if the code I'm writing is *wildly* terrible...
it's just a bit unoptimized.
