I mothered the `Miro 1.1
<http://www.getmiro.com/blog/2008/01/announcing-miro-11-dramatically-faster-bittorrent/>`_
release earlier today.  Then I decided to push out `PyBlosxom 1.4.3
<http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/blog/releases/pyblosxom.1.4.3.html>`_ which I
have been sitting on for a month.  Then after talking with `paulproteus
<http://www.asheesh.org/>`_, I decided to go for the hat-trick and released
`Lyntin 4.2 <http://lyntin.sourceforge.net/>`.

w00t for releasing three software thingies in one day!  Boo for sitting on two
of them for extended periods of time.
