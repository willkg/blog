Discovered that O'Reilly has a thing called 
`Ignite <http://ignite.oreilly.com/>`_
which sounds just like 
`Pecha Kucha <http://www.pecha-kucha.org/>`_.
In regards to the Boston versions of both of these events, the most recent 
`Ignite - Boston <http://ignite.oreilly.com/boston/>`_ has
`video recordings of the presentations <http://ignite.oreilly.com/2009/02/ignite-boston-5-wrap-up-videos.html>`_.
