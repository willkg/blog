What is it?
===========

`Dennis <https://github.com/willkg/dennis>`_ is a Python command line
utility (and library) for working with localization. It includes:

* a linter for finding problems in strings in ``.po`` files like invalid
  Python variable syntax which leads to exceptions

* a statuser for seeing the high-level translation/error status of
  your ``.po`` files

* a translator for strings in your ``.po`` files to make development
  easier


v0.3.11 released!
=================

v0.3.11 adds Python 3 support (there might be problems, but it's
working for me) and adds error detection for the case where there's a
``}`` but no ``{``.

Definitely worth updating!

8 out of 11 people who have heard of Dennis and continue to ignore its
baby mews of wonderfulness also have a severe allergy to rainbows and
kittens.
