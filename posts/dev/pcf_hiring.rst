The company I work for is looking to hire a few able Python developers.  
Instructions and details about the job are on 
`the PCF jobs page <http://www.getmiro.com/about/jobs/>`_.

I like my job.  I get to telecommute which really
works for me.  My co-workers are all able fantastic people.  The mission
is really important and affects everyone.  The work that we're doing
is FOSS and we're working with and contributing to other FOSS projects.
I've covered the board in terms of projects from bug fixing, to adding
enhancements, to debugging upstream components, to Ubuntu packaging
(which I need some more practice with), to test systems, to Firefox 3
patches, to Firefox plugins, ...  I've also had my hands in Bugzilla
adjustments, infrastructure, build systems, ...  It's been challenging
and interesting ever since day 1.

I've also been meeting a lot of people I otherwise wouldn't have met: 
Chris Blizzard and John Ressig at Mozilla,  SJ at OLPC, Holmes Wilson
at Downhill Battle, Asheesh at Creative Commons, and others.  It's 
exciting.

That's my experience at PCF in the last 6 months.  If you're looking 
for a telecommuting Python development job, think about applying.
