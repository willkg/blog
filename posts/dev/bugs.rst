`this post on Bug Guilt Trips <https://inessential.com/2003/11/12/bug_guilt_trips>`_ and
`this <http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2003_11.html#004358>`_
was super!  But I have to add the following which account for almost
all the bug/feature related emails I get:

* *It would be more efficient if...*  (this is my personal favorite 
  since it's almost never accompanied by any kind of explanation as to
  why the sender thinks it's more efficient or what conditions the
  existing code is inefficient in)
* *You need feature x, otherwise no one will use <software>...*
* *It would be more user-friendly if...*
* *Everyone will want feature x...*
* *Your documentation is terrible...*

The last one is totally true.  But it's not because I'm a bad person--it's
more because I'm pretty much a one-man band and I just don't have time to
do everything, so some items suffer until enough people complain (or
better yet--contribute).

With Lyntin, I think I've got a really decent user base that's pretty
able considering that the documentation is fairly lacking.  I wish they
were a bit more communicative, but otherwise, it's perfect for my 
tastes.  Easy to deal with, friendly, mature, not overly needy, and
pretty supportive.  It's one of those things that I think would be
somewhat spoiled if I lowered the bar of entry to using Lyntin by
making it all user-friendly and such.  Who knows?  The main important
thing to keep in the back of everyone's mind is that Lyntin development
is so totally not my day job and I'm more interested in a sophisticated
framework than I am in a fancy user interface.
