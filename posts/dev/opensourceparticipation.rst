I'm on the mailing lists for 
`OZ <http://www.openzaurus.org/oz_website/content/news>`_
and `OE <http://openembedded.org/oe_wiki>`_
because I own a Sharp Zaurus 5600 and at some point I'll have some 
time to play with it enough to get it to the point where it helps 
me in my daily life.  I haven't had any time to devote to it in the 
last four months though, which is unfortunate.

Anyhow, someone on the openzaurus-users mailing list complained that 
there's no support for the 5600 to which Michael (one of the three 
and a half people who worked on OZ) responded, expressing a lot of
frustration, then said this (and I'm quoting him slightly out of
context):

   And just to prevent misunderstandings, I don't want to be thanked for
   all the work... I don't want anything at all except participation. I
   want to work in a team bringing the community forward - I want people to
   realize, they're not helping _us_ to produce a great handheld operating
   system, they're helping _themselves_ and by doing that, helping each
   other. After all, this is what I thought was open source.


On all of the projects that I've been a part of or led, that's **exactly**
what I hoped and prayed would happen.  I have a couple of projects right 
now where there are people interested, but nothing is happening because 
I'm not driving it [1]_.  Those projects will die because I'm just one man--I 
can't drive all projects I'm involved in unless I quit my job (which is the
only income stream I have).  

I'm not sure that's what open source is.  But I wish more community 
sprung around open source projects.  My experience has been that people
just want the features they want.  They're demand-oriented consumers and
it boggles their minds that I haven't coded up their favorite feature.
It's so ego-centric.  There's a big world out there!  6.5 billion 
different lists of favorite features!

.. [1] I'm not even a great driver--I'm ok and I get things moving forward, but
   I certainly lack the finesse that I've seen other project drivers use.  For
   example, Bruce Perens guiding `UserLinux <http://www.userlinux.com/>`_ is
   riveting.  I suspect that I drive through sheer force of will rather than
   sheer leadership--which doesn't really do anyone much good.
