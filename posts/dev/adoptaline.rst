`PCF <http://pculture.org/>`_ is the 
non-profit organization I work for working to build a distribution system 
for video and audio on the Internet that has no bottlenecks, no filter 
points, uses open standards, and Free Software.

Most of the software that we write is written in Python.  Miro, an Internet 
video player, is written in Python and runs on a variety of platforms.  
Miro Guide and Miro LocalTV are both systems that are written in Python
using Django.  Miro Fullscreen is written in Python using Clutter.

Python has made it possible for a very very small group of us to tackle such
a large project with very limited resources.

Earlier this week, we launched our `Adopt a Line of Code
<http://getmiro.com/adopt/>`_ fundraising campaign to help us fund the work
we're doing.  No one has ever done a fundraising campaign like this before.  We
think it could be a good model for other Open Source and Free Software projects
to raise funds.

Take a moment to check out the `Adoption Center <http://getmiro.com/adopt/>`_
and adopt your very own line of code!  Support us in our work to make video
open for everyone.
