Wesley's been helping finding multi-session issues.  We ended up implementing
readline in the textui, echo in the textui, #snoop command for disabling
snooping on non-current-sessions, message scoping for LTDATA messages,
and fixed a bunch of bugs as well.  I also fixed up my repository script
on the web-site and coallated all of Sebastian's emails into one big file
which I plan to read through and verify I completed everything he's been
asking for over the last year.

When all that's done, I'm going to take a break for Lyntin for a while
and fix minor bugs and otherwise let the code-base bake.
