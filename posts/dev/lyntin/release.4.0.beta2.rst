There's something wonderful about releasing software.  I think it's
probably the relief associated with throwing it to the world and
knowing that you're done with it.  Of course, in this case, since
it's another beta, that isn't entirely the case.  Though I don't
plan on touching it for a few days, at least.

Anyhow, more information at
`<http://lyntin.sourceforge.net/>`_.

Now I'm going to take a nap and get my clippers and go to a party
because I get to sleep an extra hour tonight.  Whee!
