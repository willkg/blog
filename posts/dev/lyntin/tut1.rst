I wrote a tutorial on writing basic Lyntin modules.  Hopefully
it helps to fill a void in coming up to speed on Lyntin module
writing.  I'll probably add more tutorials as time goes on...
Oh.  Now that I think about it, I should have the Lyntin site
just grab my RSS feed for the status.  Mmm...  I'll have to toss
that around.
