I've passed off Lyntin maintainership to Eugene a few days ago but
made the official announcement today on both the mailing list
and the web-site.

It's sort of bitter-sweet for me.  Sweet in that I needed to drop a project or
two because I've got too many.  Bitter in that I've spent a lot of time working
on Lyntin and I'm leaving with a few things I had wanted to do, but never got
around to doing.  Even so, it was time to hand it off.  So ends a chapter of my
development life.
