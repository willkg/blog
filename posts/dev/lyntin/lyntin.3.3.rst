This will be the last release before 4.0 which is scheduled around
October 2003.  There's some heavy things that are in the plans to be
redone between now and then.  Read the roadmap for more details and
watch this site for news.

Thanks to the folks who helped make this a clean release--their help
in the last few weeks discovering and diagnosing bugs has been great!
