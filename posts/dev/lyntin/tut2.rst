I spent a few hours working through a second tutorial for Lyntin
module development.  The first one covers the basics of developing
modules in Lyntin and also walks through the basics of creating
Lyntin commands.  This one walks through the basics of hook
usage.

I don't have any ideas for writing a third tutorial, so I'll wait 
until I'm inspired.
