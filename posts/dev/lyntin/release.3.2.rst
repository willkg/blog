I've been kind of dragging my feet about releasing Lyntin 3.2 because
I haven't been getting any feedback from the community.  So either no
one is using it, or no one replies on the mailing list.  Oh well--what
can a developer do?

This release has some really great features.  I added a scheduling
system and re-wrote the ticker to use it.  I wrote a #schedule command
which allows you to schedule events to kick off using one of several
time specifications.  It's also got a new #grep command which goes
through the databuffer and allows for printing of match context.  There
are some bug fixes and some refactoring and stream-lining.  For the
most part, it's a clean-up release.

And now I'm going to kick my feet up and work on all the other things
that I've been neglecting.
