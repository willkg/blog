`Lyntin <http://lyntin.sourceforge.net/>`_, one of the projects I 
spent many many hours on, is now 
`listed in the FreeBSD ports system <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/ports.cgi?query=lyntin&stype=all>`_.

**Updates:**

12/20/2004: The FreeBSD ports work was done by Ste.  Turns out this 
got Rob excited so much, he 
`built an ebuild <http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74658>`_
for Gentoo!  More information in the comments.
