After a hiatus, I made some changes to the 
`Lyntin website <http://lyntin.sourceforge.net/>`_ after looking
at the `Groovy <http://groovy.codehaus.org/>`_ web-site which I
discovered after reading `Ted's blog <http://www.sauria.com/blog>`_.

It's interesting how I can work on something for tens of iterations honing
it here and tweaking it there.  Then I'll see something that's very similar
to what I'm doing and suddenly everything clicks and *voila* I realize
what big changes need to be made for a dramatic improvement.

Anyhow, there's a bunch of stuff in CVS for Lyntin that should get
summed up into a release.  I may tackle Telnet LINEMODE handling (which
really needs to get done) and also the MCCP plugin.  Eugene has a
really slick 
`curses ui <http://lyntin.sourceforge.net/repository.php?id=%2Fui%2Fcursesui.dat>`_
which I think has reached a point where it should get included in the 
main distribution.

Things are afoot once more!
