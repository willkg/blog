Well, I haven't touched Lyntin in the last week because I've been busy doing
that work and that holiday thing.  But now the plan is to go through all of the
Lyntin-devl email, look for issues I missed, toss them all in one big todo
list, and adjust the roadmap accordingly.  Depending on how that goes, I'll be
releasing Lyntin 3.0 in the next few days.

It's been a really long road (14 months or so now) and it'll be nice to finish
it and get it out the door.
