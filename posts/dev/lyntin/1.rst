I was looking to release 3.0 this week, but I'm going to re-write
the ticker functionality and the logging functionality so they're
both managers.  I also want to investigate decoupling hooks from
the hooks module or at least provide some registration mechanism
so that module writers can create their own hooks and access
hooks written by other module writers.

I also want to review all the mailing-list archives for things I
intended to do, but then didn't do as well as Sebastian's emails
to see what ideas he had that are now appropriate to do.
