Conan had sent me MCCP handling code back in August or September.  It
took a while to design the filter hooks that needed to go into Lyntin
4.0 to accomodate network-level data fixing (encryption, compression, 
...).  After I had added those filter hooks, I never quite got enough
time to sit down and finish up the MCCP module...

Until now.

Find the first draft of the Lyntin MCCP module `here </~willkg/dev/lyntin/>`_
with the rest of my Lyntin modules and rejoice that I finally got this off my
todo list!  w00t!
