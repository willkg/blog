I went through and overhauled the FAQ and then updated all the existing
Lyntin documentation.  I also moved some information around between
things.

There are some things I want to clean up, but I think I'll be doing
a 3.0 release in December--probably this weekend or next weekend.
After that, it'll be a series of minor point releases whenever we
accumulate enough stuff to make a new minor point release.  We'll
do major point releases whenever we make enough architectural changes
to warrant such a thing.  After 3.0 is released, emphasis will go
towards generating some more documentation on building Lyntin modules
as well as fixing the existing modules that I've created and haven't
really updated in a while.

All in good time.  All in all, though, things are looking extremely
good.  Today I implemented a quick module to tell me if I have new
email.  I wrote it in the space of 5 minutes and it works wonderfully.
