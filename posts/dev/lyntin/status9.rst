The mailing list has been really active.  There is definitely a
BIG correlation between mailing list activity and my motivation
towards fixing things.  Some of the things Eugene has said have
irked me, but in general he's providing a lot of solid observations
which (I think) have led to some really great changes.

In the last few weeks, we've:

* fixed a couple of bugs
* optimized out the get_engine() silliness
* whittled down the managers (there's still some more to do)
* optimized the get_current_session() routine
* optimized the filter_mapper case of hook spamming
* made some really awesome changes to the python_cmd that make
  it far more usable

All good stuff none of which would have happened with a quiet
mailing list.
