I've just felt really inspired lately.  I cruised through a color
overhaul which fixed the totally borked handling of color formatting
I had in there before.  I also added a NamedWindow class to the
tkui which is kind of neat.  If that wasn't enough, I added bell
handling and fixed up some stuff to make telnet control code
issues easier to discover.

I've got a lot of changes.  I think I'm going to release a 3.0.1
really soon.

At some point, I hope I feel motivated to do the distutils stuff.
I haven't even researched it enough to figure out if we want to
be doing distutils stuff or what code changes it would entail.
