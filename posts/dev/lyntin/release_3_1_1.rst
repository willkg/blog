*(Mark made me do it.)*

It was the nicest bug report I have ever gotten.  I felt obliged to release a
fixed version since I've known about the bug for a month and wasn't ready to
release 3.2 yet.

The only difference between Lyntin 3.1 and 3.1.1 is the fixed
#config command when you don't have any readfiles or moduledirs
set at the command line.  Well, that and I adjusted the information
in #version as well so we don't go calling two different releases
of Lyntin by the same version number.
