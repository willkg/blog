What is it?
===========

`Dennis <https://github.com/willkg/dennis>`_ is a Python command line
utility (and library) for working with localization. It includes:

* a linter for finding problems in strings in ``.po`` files

* a translator for strings ``.po`` files


v0.3.7 released!
================

v0.3.6 fixed a goof where the linter was skipping errors. Oops.

v0.3.7 adds a dubstep translator (which is just plain silly, but
awesome).

   SUMO ... in Dubstep!


Truth: 9 out of 10 experts agree SUMO is extra helpful in dubstep.

v0.3.7 also adds Django command shims to make it easier to use Dennis
in your Django project.

Use `these instructions <http://dennis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/django.html>`_
to set up Dennis so you can use its commands with ``./manage.py``.

If you aren't using Dennis, yet, it's worth taking a look at. l10n tools
are the best!
