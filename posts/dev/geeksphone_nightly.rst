Got my `Geeksphone Peak <http://www.geeksphone.com/>`_ yesterday in
the mail, but hadn't had a chance to open the package until today
(chaotic life stuff).

I'm running Debian Testing and had done some Gaia/FirefoxOS work in
late 2012. I had my development environment still set up including adb
and fastboot.

I wanted to switch the phone to the nightly channel which is what I
was using (or thought I was using) with my Unagi. Mostly I followed
`Updating and Tweaking your Firefox OS Developer Preview
phone/Geeksphone
<https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/06/updating-and-tweaking-your-firefox-os-developer-preview-phonegeeksphone/>`_.

After doing that, I moved my SIM card over as well as the Micro SD
card I had in my Unagi phone. The Micro SD card has all my media on
it---not my suer data. I thought about moving my user data over, but
I've had the Unagi so long that I figured my user data is probably in
a funky state anyhow and better to start over.

Couple of thoughts:

1. The nightly build is version 2.0.0-prerelease.
2. The phone is a lot bigger than the Unagi---it'll take a bit of
   getting used to.
3. Most things worked fine. I even got a marketing message from
   T-Mobile minutes after I inserted my SIM card and got on the
   network.

There are a few issues (the camera is not working at all). I need to
spend some time with Bugzilla to file those with useful
data. Regardless, the phone is working pretty well and I'm probably
going to switch to it as my primary phone soon. That might give me
some incentive to finish rewriting `magic10ball
<http://willkg.github.io/magic10ball/>`_.
