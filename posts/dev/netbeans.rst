At work my dev environment consists of bash, vim, ant, jdk 1.3, vss, and
a couple dozen bash aliases, bash scripts and python scripts.  I spend most
of the day in and out of vim sessions debugging various things.

Every 6 months or so I try to switch to Emacs full-time, but I need all 
the pieces to be there in order to switch and I don't have a lot of time at
work to figure it out, practice and get used to a new dev environment.  Thus
for the last 3-4 years, I've been hanging onto vim, bash, ant, jdk 1.3, vss
and tweaking my scripts to make the process as smooth as possible.  There
are parts that work really well and parts that suck.  Debugging sucks.

I figured I'd check out Eclipse and Netbeans.  I spent 30 minutes trying to
figure out how to download Eclipse and set it up on Windows XP and got no
where.  I'm not really sure how so many people can use it--it's really
difficult to get started.  I spent an hour trying to get Netbeans to work
with jdk 1.4.2 while compiling our stuff with jdk 1.3 and without stomping
on the version of Java that runs applets in Internet Explorer.  That sucked
and could have been a *lot* easier.

After that, Netbeans seems to work pretty well.  I'm running 4.0 beta 2.  I
bump into NullPointerExceptions regularly, but Netbeans seems to recover from
them pretty well without me having to restart.  It's decent.  I fixed my
first bug today with the "new dev environment".  It's already faster to
iterate between the steps of the analyze, fix, test cycle than it was before.
I've also caught a few bugs I didn't know about which have been there for
a long time all quiet and hidden away.

I still want to switch to Emacs, but it'll have to wait until I have more
free time to make it work.
