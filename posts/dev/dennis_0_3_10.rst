What is it?
===========

`Dennis <https://github.com/willkg/dennis>`_ is a Python command line
utility (and library) for working with localization. It includes:

* a linter for finding problems in strings in ``.po`` files

* a statuser for seeing the high-level status of your ``.po`` files

* a translator for strings ``.po`` files


v0.3.10 released!
=================

v0.3.8 fixed mismatched errors in plural strings. Thanks Mike!

v0.3.9 fixed two false positives in error detection.

v0.3.10 adds the status subcommand and the Zombie transform which,
like the dubstep transform, is silly but fun.

   SUMO ... in Zombie!


45 out of 47 Djangonauts use the Zombie transform to make their site
accessible to those who have departed. This could open up your app to
millions of new users. Truth.
