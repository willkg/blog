Last year, I went to RustConf 2019 in Portland. It was a lovely conference.
Everyone I saw was so exuberantly happy to be there--it was just remarkable.
It was my first RustConf. Plus while I've been sort-of learning Rust for a
while and cursorily related to Rust things (I work on crash ingestion and debug
symbols things), I haven't really done any Rust work. Still, it was a
remarkable and very exciting conference.

RustConf 2020 was entirely online. I'm in UTC-4, so it occurred during my
afternoon and evening. I spent the entire time watching the RustConf 2020
stream and skimming the channels on Discord.  Everyone I saw on the channels
were so exuberantly happy to be there and supportive of one another--it was
just remarkable. Again! Even virtually!

I missed the in-person aspect of a conference a bit. I've still got this thing
about conferences that I'm getting over, so I liked that it was virtual because
of that and also it meant I didn't have to travel to go.

I enjoyed all of the sessions--they're all top-notch! They were all pretty
different in their topics and difficulty level. The organizers should get gold
stars for the children's programming between sessions. I really enjoyed the
"CAT!" sightings in the channels--that was worth the entrance fee.

This is a summary of the talks I wrote notes for.

I love RustConf keynotes. They're intentional, thoughtful, and just the best.


Error Handling Isn't All About Errors
=====================================

Jane Lusby

I've been confused about error handling because there are so many options and
it seems like the options change over time. I found this really helpful.


How to Start a Solo Project that You’ll Stick With
==================================================

Harrison Bachrach

I've been doing solo projects for ages and sticking with them isn't really a
problem that I have. But this is a lovely talk and generalizes to keeping
momentum on any kind of thing through habit formation.


Bending the Curve: A Personal Tutor at Your Fingertips
======================================================

Esteban Kuber

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6X7Ada0ugE

The explanatory errors the Rust compiler spits out are profoundly helpful. This
talk which covers why that is, how it came to be, and where it's going was
fascinating.


My First Rust Project: Creating a Roguelike with Amethyst
=========================================================

The `closing keynote at RustConf 2018
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKLntZcp27M>`_ covered ECS, so I was a little
familiar with some of the things covered in this talk. I hadn't seen `Amethyst
<https://amethyst.rs/>`_ before, so everything about Amethyst was new to me. In
the Discord channel for this talk, people kept mentioning `Bevy
<https://bevyengine.org/>`_. I didn't see any comparisons between the two
engines.

My notes suggest that I look at both engines at some point, but I don't write
games and don't have time to explore that, so I'm not sure what i was thinking
at the time.


Controlling Telescope Hardware with Rust
========================================

Ashley Hauck

The pictures that Ashley got on her telescope were stunning. The talk walks
through the setup and code involved and it's amazing stuff.


Macros for a More Productive Rust
=================================

I'm not at the macro stage, yet, but it was really helpful to watch this so as
to get an understanding of how macros work in Rust, the restrictions, and how
they affect compilation.


Rust for Non-Systems Programmers
================================

Rebecca Turner

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBvcK_nXUEg

This talk was possibly the most relevant to me because I'm still learning Rust.
I have a lot of notes from this one and plan to re-watch it soon.


Closing Keynote

This talk blew my mind. And the costume changes!!!
