It's really neat to watch skilled project managers step up to the podium
and in a few paragraphs walk through what's happened, what the options
are, why he/she is choosing a specific option, and then examine the
process through which they arrived at that option and suggest ways
of fixing the process itself.  I like projects like this.

Anyhow, Guido has 
`written up his thoughts on the J2 proposal <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.devel/63486>`_
and seems like they're sticking 
with the @ proposal. I'm not sure what that means. I look forward to 
diving into Dive into Python and catch up on some of the language
features I'm really missing out on.  It'd help my projects out a bunch.
