`Mark Edgar's PuTTYcyg <http://gecko.gc.maricopa.edu/~medgar/puttycyg/>`_
patch is **awesome**.  I've always had difficulties
with the Cygwin console and using PuTTYcyg makes me happier.
Definitely worth looking at if the Cygwin console issues (resize issues,
fonts, copy/paste issues, ...) make life irritating.
