I'm going to be doing some pretty dicey pyblosxom changes over the
next day.  This web-site is liable to go up and down faster than
a pogo stick!

You might be greeted with bugs!  Stack traces smeared in pink and
colors repugnant to the human eye!  Strange hexidecimal incantations
that look more like inscriptions in a pyramid tomb than
meaningful web-site error data!  Be wary!  BE VERY WARY!

Don't fret--it'll all be over in a few days.
