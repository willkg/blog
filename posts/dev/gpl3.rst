I went to the 
`FSF GPL 3 release event <http://www.fsf.org/news/gplv3_launched>`_
and it was really interesting.  There's been a lot of discussion and heated 
exchanges over the `GPL 3 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>`_,
but I was in grad school and wasn't really paying much attention.  Listening 
to the discussions at the event about GPL version 3 was really
enlightening.

Personally, I'm excited about the license.  It allays some fears I've always
had as a developer.  Going foward, I'll be putting the majority of my work
under the GPL version 3 license.
