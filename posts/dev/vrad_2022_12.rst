Today is `Volunteer Responsibility Amnesty Day
<https://www.volunteeramnestyday.net/>`__ where I spend some time taking stock
of things and maybe move some projects to the done pile.

In June, I ran a
:doc:`Volunteer Responsibility Amnesty Day <volunteer_responsibility_amnesty_day_2022_06>` [1]_
for Mozilla Data Org because the idea really struck a chord with me and we were
about to embark on 2022h2 where one of the goals was to "land planes" and finish
projects. I managed to pass off `Dennis <https://github.com/mozilla/dennis>`__
and end `Puente <https://github.com/willkg/puente>`__. I also spent some time
mulling over better models for maintaining a lot of libraries.

.. [1] I gave the post an exceedingly long slug. I wish I had thought about
       future me typing that repeatedly and made it shorter like I did this time
       around.

This time around, I'm just organizing myself.

Here's the list of things I'm maintaining in some way that aren't the big
services that I work on:

   :next step: think about dropping this at some point


That's too many things. I need to pare the list down. There are a few I could
probably sunset, but not any time soon.

I'm also thinking about a maintenance model where I'm squishing it all into a
burst of activity for all the libraries around some predictable event like
Python major releases.

I tried that out this fall and did a release of everything except Bleach (more
on that next year) and rob-bugson which is a Firefox addon. I think I'll do
that going forward. I need to document it somewhere so as to avoid the
pestering of "Is this project active?" issues. I'll do that next year.
