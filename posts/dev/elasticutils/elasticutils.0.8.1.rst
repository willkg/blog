What is it?
===========

`ElasticUtils <https://github.com/mozilla/elasticutils>`_ is a Python
library for building and executing Elasticsearch searches.


v0.8 and v0.8.1 released!
=========================

I missed the announcement for v0.8, so I'll cover both v0.8 and v0.8.1
here.

Roughly:

* ElasticUtils now requires at least pyelasticsearch 0.6
* adds ``range`` query and filter
* adds ``S.filter_raw``
* changes the ``Indexable.index`` arguments dropping ``force_insert``
  and picking up ``overwrite_existing``

For the complete list of what's new, `What's new in Version 0.8.1

Many thanks to everyone who helped out: Jannis Leidel, Rob Hudson and
