What is it?
===========

`ElasticUtils <https://github.com/mozilla/elasticutils>`_ is a Python
library for building and executing Elasticsearch searches.


v0.7 released!
==============

Turns out I haven't announced an ElasticUtils release since August
2012. Why? Partially because up until now, I always had deep-seated
problems with ElasticUtils and wasn't excited about announcing yet
another version with things I disliked in it.

I feel really good about v0.7 for a variety of reasons. Let me tell
you some of them:

1. We switched from pyes to pyelasticsearch. I'm really happy with
   this.

2. There was a monumental effort to fix sharp edges in the API,
   generalize bits that needed generalizing, improve the quality of
   the software, improve the test suite, improve the docs, ...

   Doing a ``git diff --stat`` tells me::

       65 files changed, 6164 insertions(+), 2716 deletions(-)

   That's a lot of change for a small project like this.


If you're using ElasticUtils, I highly encourage you to update to
v0.7. We're using it on `Input <https://input.mozilla.org/>`_ and
`Support <https://support.mozilla.org/>`_ already.
