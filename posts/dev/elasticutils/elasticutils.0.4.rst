What is it?
===========

`ElasticUtils <https://github.com/mozilla/elasticutils>`_ is a Python
library for building and executing ElasticSearch searches.


v0.4 released!
==============

I released v0.4 a couple of days ago. This release adds new functionality,
fixes some issues, adds more tests, and includes improved documentation.

On top of that, we removed the requirement for Django and moved the
Django-aiding components into ``elasticutils.contrib.django``. I
personally like this because it makes it much easier to write test
scripts to see how things react.

For the complete list of what's new, `What's new in Version 0.4

If you have any questions, let us know! We hang out on ``#elasticutils``
on irc.mozilla.org.
