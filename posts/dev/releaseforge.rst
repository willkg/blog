I've been doing SourceForge releases for years and it's kind of a pain
in the ass and I've always dreaded the two or three hours it takes
to get all the pieces in line and do a release.

Steven Armstrong mentioned using
`ReleaseForget <http://releaseforge.sourceforge.net/>`_ which 
makes half of that process so much easier to deal with.  Recommended!
