I got my Python Cookbook in the mail and I've been reading through
it and as I've been doing that I've been revising bits of Stringbean 
accordingly.  

I also finished up a basic emotes module, adjusted the startup code,
added handling for multiple names, added drop-in modules, added a 
command manager, added commands on objects/rooms, and started a
driverapi module for abstracting driver code from its own 
implementation.
