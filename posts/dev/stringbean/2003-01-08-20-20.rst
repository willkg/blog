I finally finished the complete overhaul of the Stringbean driver.  It's
now separated into a driver and a mudlib.  I have everything implemented
as a series of hooks and managers.  Some portions are a bit awkward,
though and could probably be re-written.  Some components are 
implemented simplistically for now until I (or someone else) design
and implement a more sophisticated version.  All in good time, though.

Currently implemented: commands, emotes, heartbeats, lookables, exits,
simple NPCs, connect, disconnect, and some other stuff.
