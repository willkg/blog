There isn't much progress on Stringbean yet.  I do want to re-tackle
it when Lyntin 3.0 is released and development dies down to a slow
murmer.  The first thing I'm going to do is overhaul all the Varium
code and include a lot of the changes that I made for Bluemud
(ansi parsing, word wrapping, ...).  Then build an online tavern
from that.  It's not going to be much of an adventure mud from the
beginning--I just want somewhere I can hang out with cool people (online).
