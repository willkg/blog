I'm on this coding kick right now.  For some reason I decided
to go dig up Stringbean and see how it was doing.  It's doing fine!
Well, except for the fact it wouldn't start up.  So I did some fixing
and now it's fine and starts up and everything seems hunky dory.  I have
no clue what I was working on last.

Anyhow, for anyone interested,
`here's a tarball of a minimally working version of Stringbean
</~willkg/stringbean/stringbean.01212004.tar.gz>`_.  I release
it under the GPL.  I might at some point work on it some more, but if
not, there it is.
