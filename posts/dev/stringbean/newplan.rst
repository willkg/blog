So I was putzing around overhauling old Varium code which I haven't
really touched in a couple of years when it occurred to me that the
code I'm overhauling involves features I don't really care about--at
least not at this stage of the game.  This sudden realization caused
me to re-evaluate what I was doing and take a new approach.

I took the testserver I wrote for Lyntin and expanded it into a series
of modules and 1300 lines of code later I now have a working mud
that has multiple rooms, heartbeats, multiple players, and a series
of other things.  More importantly, it gives me a good base to add on
new features as I need them--giving me time to architect things as
I go along rather than doing the whole thing up front.

I need to do a few more things before it has enough of a a critical mass 
to be interesting.
