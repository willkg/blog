I redid exits, command handling, descriptions, word wrapping, and a 
few other things.  Then in the tavern I'm working on, I added tables,
a hatrack, a guestbook, a grandfather clock, and Neil who sits at his 
bar and waxes philosophical about the old days.

All in all it's coming along very very nicely.  There are a few things
I need to change to improve command handling and looking at things.
Then to work on more complex issues.
