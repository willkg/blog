I did a third attempt to get Eclipse working and I got it mostly working
but it didn't jive with our codebase very well and it takes GOBS and GOBS
of memory.

I decided NetBeans took up too much memory as well (200MB at various points
depending on what I was doing) and I kept bumping into weird 
NullPointerExceptions in the IDE itself.  If I had more time, I'd spend
more time: a) fleshing them out, b) providing bug reports.  But the issues
were too sporadic and it was taking too much time to come up to speed to
the point where I could use it all the time.  And the VSS plugin was kind
of flakey and made me nervous.

I uninstalled both NetBeans and Eclipse and installed Emacs.  I stuck
Viper mode at 2 and after reading documentation for a bit, I finally made
some connections I didn't make the last time around with Emacs and I've
been working with it most of today and part of yesterday without any
issues.
