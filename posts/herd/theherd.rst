I was working at a co-working place until this week when I decided to
stop working there. The place is really cool, but they're focusing more
on renters who are in startups or in startup mode or in the startup
community... and I'm not really like that. Also, it was $200 a month and
I had this nagging voice in my head that kept telling me that I could
spend 6 months of rent on a new laptop instead.

The things I wanted out of a co-working space were:

#. a place to go outside of my apartment to work, and
#. hang out with other developers, and
#. convenient

Thus, I'm starting the `Nomadic Telecommuting
Herd <http://herd.jottit.com/>`__ (or "the herd" for short).

The premise behind it is that herd members build a schedule of places
we're "grazing" at. If you want to join a herd that day, so be it.
Primarily we'd graze at peoples' apartments/houses/whatever and
telecommuter-friendly establishments (cafes, coffee shops, libraries,
...). Chris points out that there are a lot of wifi hot-spots, so it
shouldn't be hard to find places to congregate at. This herd will be in
the Cambridge/Somerville area of Massachusetts.

If you're interested, check out the web-site and hop on
``irc.freenode.net`` in ``#herd``. If the group gets too big, we'll
split into smaller herds either focusing on geography, common interests,
hair color or something along those lines.
