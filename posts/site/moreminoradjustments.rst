A couple of friends pointed out to me my META tag to refresh from
/~willkg/ to /~willg/blog/ was borked and while it worked fine in
`Mozilla <http://www.mozilla.org/>`__ and derivatives (which are the
only browsers I use), it didn't work at all in Internet Explorer. All
fixed now though.

For future reference, the "good code" is like this:

.. code-block:: html

   <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL=http://bluesock.org/~willkg/blog/">
