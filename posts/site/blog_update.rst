I updated my blog to use PyBlosxom from git master HEAD as well as
updates to plugins that are now part of the PyBlosxom core. There have
been a bunch of bugfixes, so my blog works a lot better now. I also
abandoned a bunch of home-made plugins for their suped-up equivalents in
PyBlosxom core.

I wrote a script that grabs my `identi.ca <http://identi.ca/willkg>`__
dents and generates local entries for them. I figured most people
probably don't follow me on identi.ca (which is a shame), so I'll bring
it here.

Then I spent about 30 minutes tweaking the CSS to make the blog look a
little better. It's not super, but it's good enough for now.
