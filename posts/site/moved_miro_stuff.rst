I work at `Participatory Culture Foundation <http://pculture.org/>`__
and I have a work blog there that I use primarily for blogging about
things related to PCF, Miro development, Miro-related development and
other things of that ilk. It's on a WordPress system.

I decided after a while that having two blogs sucked. Also, I don't like
Wordpress. Also also, I was getting obscene amounts of comment spam on
my work blog.

As such, I did a couple of pushes to finish up PyBlosxom 1.5 enough so
that I could write a tags plugin that I like so that I could migrate.
Then I wrote a Wordpress to PyBlosxom migration script and the result is
that I'm now blogging here for all Miro related things. Since it's
easier to blog here, I'll probably be talking more about Miro-land.
w00t!
