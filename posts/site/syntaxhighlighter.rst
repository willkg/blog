I just switched to using
`SyntaxHighlighter <http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/>`__.
It's a JavaScript-based syntax highlighter. I decided to use this
because I think it'll play well with Planets and my blog.

If you notice any problems, let me know. Only one of my entries uses it
so far--I have to go back and update entries.
