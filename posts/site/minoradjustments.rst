First off, it's now "http://www.bluesock.org/~willkg/blog/". I followed
`Rael's
directions <http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/faq.shtml#general_hiding_blosxom_cgi>`__
and implemented the mod_rewrite adjustments. That worked super. Then it
created some mild issues that I'm sorting out now. Namely, I have all
kinds of content in different formats: html, shtml, php, and now
pyblosxom entries. So I'm going to do a massive normalization of all the
content and get rid of the stuff I don't update ever. Getting there.

Anyhow, so my point is that my entire site is now in a state of flux as
it gets re-absorbed into more of a blog with a slight amount of static
content.
