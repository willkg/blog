Rick kindly pointed out that comments on my blog were broken. Totally my
fault--I've been working on PyBlosxom on and off and a couple of weeks
ago I updated my blog to use the latest version of PyBlosxom in git
master and didn't grab the latest comments plugin.

Comments were getting into the moderator queue (I moderate all
comments), but when the comments plugin went to send me a notification
email, it'd die.

They're working again.
