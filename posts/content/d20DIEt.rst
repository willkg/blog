I figured I'd join the diet fad and present my 100%-satisfaction-guaranteed
best-results-ever fad diet.  I hope to make a million dollars selling
copious amounts of totally non-relevant diet materials and possibly
confusing people in regards to the basics of nutrition using highly
ambiguous terms and gross misrepresentations of how things work.  I will
then give those million dollars over to various charities and studies
seeking to help people fix their confidence, self-image, and alleviate
the ill-effects psychological or otherwise of obesity.

This diet is a little different since it's not really a diet but rather
a DIEt.  See, it's the d20 DIEt.  It's better than sliced bread.  You'll 
lose the weight you should be losing rather than the weight you think you 
want to lose.

This weblog entry summarizes the diet rather than goes into long-form.  I'm
saving that for my soon-to-be-best-selling book about the DIEt.

**step 1: figure out what character class you are**

You start by figuring out what character class you want to be.  Pick up a Player's 
Handbook v.3.0 or v.3.5 and pick your favorite character class.  The class 
you choose affects how aggressive you are about your DIEt.  Classes that have 
initally poor Will saves will be less aggressive than classes that have hefty 
Will saves.  Everyone starts at level 1 of their chosen character class.


**step 2: how it works**

Everyone is allowed to eat three meals a day consisting of an appropriate
amount of appropriate food sans dessert, chips, appetizers and such.  They
make will checks for everything else with the following DCs:

==================  ====
what                DC
==================  ====
between-meal snack  10
after-dinner snack  15
dessert             15
chips/appetizers    15
==================  ====

If you miss your Will check (i.e. you can't help yourself), then you get
to eat the thing mentioned.  If you make your Will check (i.e. your will
prevails), then you don't eat it.  Period.

You don't get to make multiple Will checks for the same thing.  If you make
your Will check for dessert, then you don't get to have dessert.  You don't
get to make a Will check for a brownie and another for a cookie and another
for jello...  ad infinitum.

Everyone starts their DIEt on a Sunday morning.  Every sunday, you go up 
a level.  Check the Player's Handbook to see what your new Will value is.

Over time, you'll reach such a high level that you'll be making all your
Will checks and then you won't be eating anything.

As with all diets, you have to be serious and not screw around thus
deceiving yourself into lapsing.

The effective part of this diet is that it's a roll of the dice so you
don't have to dictate your own fate.

**advanced rules**

You can try subclassing, dual-classing or whatever provided that you
strictly follow character class rules in the Player's Handbook.

You can have someone else roll the dice for you.

You can use one of those dice-rolling programs available on a Palm Pilot
or other handheld device.


**thanks and such**

I'd like to thank my D&D mates and my co-worker for helping to revise
the DIEt to its current form.  I hope they in turn make a million dollars
for their kindness.
