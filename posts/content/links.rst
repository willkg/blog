I look at `Anil Dash's links log <http://www.dashes.com/links/>`__ daily
now and decided to kick up one of my own partially to give people a
glimpse of what I'm looking at day to day, but mostly because I need a
way to keep track of all these links.

Anyhow, I implemented my links "blog" as a category under my current
blog. In that category directory, I tossed a different set of templates
so that it's more "minimal" (inspired by what Anil does with his link
blog). Then I used the `filter
plugin <http://www.planetpyblosxom.org/blog/registry/filtering/filter>`__
from the `Pyblosxom
registry <http://www.planetpyblosxom.org/blog/registry?sortby=path>`__
so that I could "hide" the links blog entries from my main site (I
figure it'd be too spammy).

Took me maybe 10 minutes to implement the whole thing--5 of which were
used to update the filter plugin from the one at the link to something
that works with Pyblosxom 1.0.1 (soon to be released).
