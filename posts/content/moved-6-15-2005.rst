S and I spend last Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday moving. We
had lots of help from many places (thanks!) and overall the move went
pretty smoothly. Now we have some minor issues like we own no pots and
pans so we can't cook; our stuff is still packed and all over the place;
and we don't have much food to eat.

I've done 10 furniture-moves in the last 7 years. I've done a bunch of
non-furniture moves (mostly between corporate apartments when I was
doing consulting) as well--but those only involved one or two carloads
for each move.

If you're waiting on me to get something done, know that it's in the
queue but it's going to take me a week or two to get a critical mass of
stuff unpacked so I can continue regular activities again.
