Since I got married and since we decided to stay in the current
apartment for another year, I've been involved in a bunch of home
improvement projects to neaten things up, clean some stuff out,
re-organize, and build some furniture to make better use of space. I've
finished a set of shelves to replace one of the desks I had. I'm in the
process of building a small set of shelves to go above the counter to
use some vertical space in the kitchen for storage. I'm thinking about
building another set of shelves.

My brother-in-law uses Google Sketchup to do his drafting. I had a look
at it a couple of days ago and what he's done with it and it's pretty
wild. My problem, however, is that I'm running on Linux and I have a
preference towards Free Software and Open Source. Partially because I'd
like to share my plans with other people in non-proprietary formats and
partially because I stand a better chance of fixing things when they go
wrong.

Does anyone know of 3-d modeling/drafting/basic CAD software similar to
Sketchup that works in Linux?

As a side note, it turns out I have the same estimation problems with
home improvement projects that I have with programming projects.
Irritating.
