A few days ago, we discovered that the kitchen sink drain is blocked.
Not only that, but it's blocked below the point where the drain for the
upstairs neighbors' kitchen sink meets ours. So when they use their sink
(for example, when they clean pots from the spaghetti with clam sauce),
it backflows into our sink and then our sink overflows. Ewwww!

An "excavation" guy showed up at 7:45 in the morning to unblock the
sink. While he was working, I learned that garbage disposals, while
convenient, are the devil's tool and were probably invented by an evil
plumber looking for a steady flow of business. I had no idea.

Anyhow, he couldn't excavate it enough and it looks like we're going to
have to have the section of pipe replaced. That's nuts!
