I was pretty tired yesterday and had to spend some time working on the
workshop materials, so I didn't end up blogging about it at all.

Yesterday went really well. We covered communication tools and the kinds
of things you can do with them. It was a gorgeous day, S's mom came up,
and we spent a few hours sitting on the beach and playing in the surf.
Between hanging out with S's mom, playing at the beach, working on the
workshop, and feeling really tired, I didn't get around to blogging the
day at all.

Today we covered collaboration tools in the workshop. It was a cold and
rainy day. Additionally, it's sort of the middle of a really high-energy
week and everyone was pretty tired.

Afterwards, I noticed I missed a call on my cell phone. I checked my
messages to discover my little sister L had a baby at 3am this morning.
It's the first baby for my siblings, so I'm a new uncle.

I spent much of the rest of today thinking about what kind of uncle I
will be.
