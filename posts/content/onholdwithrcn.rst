I've been trying to cancel my service for 2 days now. I call them up, go
through 47 menus 2 of which involve them repeating back to me the things
I just typed into the phone in a voice not unlike DRSBAITSO, and then
finally sit on hold and listen to whatever tunes they play. Right now
they're playing Shaggy's "Wasn't Me".

Do they know what this song is about? Who's idea was it to put this on
as hold music? It reminds me of living in California when it just came
out. So that's nice. But still, I'm pretty surprised they're playing it.
What's next? Sir Mix-a-lot?

Why can't I get a human to answer the phone? Hello? Hello RCN! Pick up
the phone so I can cancel my service. Stop apologizing for the delay and
telling me how all your representatives are assisting other callers--I
don't believe you!
