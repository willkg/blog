This was the second (and last) group to be screened at the `Brattle
Theatre <http://www.brattlefilm.org/>`__. It was a lot rowdier than last
night. I'm not sure if that's because the groups were rowdier groups or
that we had some ... technical issues.

One of the genres is "mockumentary". Last night we had a film that was
very Christopher-Guest-ish which was really well done. After seeing that
I figured that all the mockumentary films would be along those lines
since there aren't too many other mockumentary films out there to derive
the concept from. Tonight, however, was pretty different. I was pretty
stunned to find out the guys who did it (their entire team was 4
guys--some of these teams had 25 people and org charts) decided to do it
2 or 3 days before the actual fest. That's pretty awesome.

Reminds me of this foreign exchange student that I knew back in college
who decided to run the Boston Marathon at a party we threw the friday
before. Then she ran it two days later and did awesome!

I digress. I got home around midnight again, grabbed some food, and then
fell into a deep coma.
