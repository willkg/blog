I was reading the Debian Weekly News (from 11/30/2004) and one of the
blurbs mentioned putting DWN in RSS format and then also mentioned that
Gmane already does this for all the mailing lists it tracks.

"Blog" versions of the pyblosxom mailing lists:

* `blog of pyblosxom-devel
  list <http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.pyblosxom.devel/>`__
* `blog of pyblosxom-user
  list <http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.pyblosxom.user/>`__

And it has RSS. RSS versions of the pyblosxom mailing lists:

* `RSS of pyblosxom-devel
  list <http://rss.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.pyblosxom.devel>`__
* `RSS of pyblosxom-user
  list <http://rss.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.pyblosxom.user>`__

That's amazing.... Talk about killer services.
