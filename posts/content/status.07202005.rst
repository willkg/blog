I had the brakes replaced on my car yesterday--that was interesting. The
guy said he had to replace the rear brakes because they were pretty
dead, but he could try to lube up the front brakes so they wouldn't make
the "I'm dying please replace me" scream of mortal anguish they've been
making for a week or so. Given that they're brakes and that they were on
their last legs, I had the guy replace them all. Curious that he
suggested the lube solution, though.

I received a whole bunch of information from NEU--so I'm off to deal
with that and get all the things I need to do done today.

Then tonight I'm going to pick up some wood from Home Depot and build a
coffee table.

I think next week, I'll start working on PyBlosxom again. I've been
following `Ian Bicking's <http://blog.ianbicking.org/>`__ blog entries
on WSGI and Paste and it's very intriguing.
