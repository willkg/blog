It's been a few weeks since my last blog entry. My classes are really
hard. This semester I'm taking Semantics in Programming Languages
(covering operational and denotational semantics and a bunch of other
stuff) and Advanced Software Development (covering structure-shy
adaptive programming, `AspectJ <http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/>`__,
`DemeterJ <http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeter/DemeterJava/>`__,
`DAJ <http://daj.sourceforge.net/>`__,
`DJ <http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeter/DJ/>`__, and various
techniques) and it's been a wild semester so far.

I've put everything else I normally do on hold until the end of the
semester when I get some downtime.

Interestingly, I wrote a `very similar blog entry last
year <http://bluesock.org/~willkg/blog/content/status.10192005.html>`__.
