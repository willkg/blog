I discovered `Why I hate Advocacy <http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2000/12/advocacy.html>`_
from `jgoerzen <http://changelog.complete.org/node/321>`_

I encounter this regularly when talking about operating systems, programming
languages, text editors, and even non-technical things like car manufacturers,
methods for making coffee, types of beer, music, politics, ....  I never 
connected it with a "want to be part of the tribe" behavior.  I wonder if 
this behavior is something that's relatively recent or dates back to primitive 
man.  Regardless, it makes it difficult to discuss things in a rational, 
objective manner to understand what's really going on and the nuances involved.

Also on jgoerzen's blog entry is a link to 
`Why smart people defend bad ideas <http://www.scottberkun.com/essays/essay40.htm>`_.
Reading the two essays back to back was really funky.
