I'm in the process of the following:

* finishing up my grad school application for NEU
* tweaking my "new" desktop so I can do some programming work on it
* working on pyblosxom 1.1 release
* finishing up a children's book S and I wrote, illustrated, and
  are publishing ourselves (more on this later [I hope])
* preparing to visit with George this weekend
* watching the Red Sox...  (whew--the anxiety in the air is as thick as
  soup!)
* trying to complete items in my infinite queue at work where the items
  are progressively more complex and potentially NP-complete--at least, it
  sure feels that way
