#. It's a shame I can't somehow use the amazing amount of heat being
   generated by my computer which is doing regression tests to drive a
   humidifier. I think if I had the processor fan blowing the hot air
   across a dish of water, I wouldn't have to have a noisy processor fan
   AND a noisy humidifier in my cube.
#. The `Groovy <http://groovy.codehaus.org/>`__ project is very
   well-named.
