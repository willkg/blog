I spent the better part of my youth doing Oddessey of the Mind (which has
gone through some difficulties and splintered as near as I can tell), 
programming, bicycling, and playing D&D.

D&D was both entertaining and also wildly educational.  I was in a 
bunch of campaigns and we were studying architecture, history, military
campaigns, meteorology, the middle ages, math, economics, sociology, 
philosophy and a variety of other topics to create worlds that were
fresh, inventive and believable.  As such, I, too, salute 
`Gary Gygax <http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080305-dd-cocreator-gary-gygax-now-beyond-scope-of-healing-spells.html>`_
on his way to the other planes.

As a side note, I noticed a large overlap between programmers 
around my age and D&D players.
