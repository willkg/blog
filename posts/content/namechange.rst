I got married last May and changed my name to my wife's name. This had
two interesting consequences. First, it surprises many people when they
find out and I have to have my memorized explanation ready to go.
Second, changing your name is really scary. I've been waiting for a
period of time where I'm not involved in any governmental anything
including flying because I don't want to confuse someone because I'm
half-way through a name change.

I started the name-changing process a couple of weeks ago. I'm now
William Kahn-Greene. I kept Guaraldi as my "maiden name"--I have no idea
what the equivalent term is for men. I've spent the greater part of the
last two weeks without "proper documentation"--that's been scary. Thank
goodness for telecommuting!

As an aside, I can't wait for my idiot government to get over this
terrorist panic. I can't imagine the next fear-craze to sweep the
nation. I secretly hope it's global warming or something similar that
has more useful consequences like energy usage overhaul and fewer
consequences like transforming into a police state and war-mongering.
