My brother has a Mac. It's a
something-or-other-with-high-end-thingies-and-stuff Mac, to be specific.
Anyhow, I have a friend who after years and years and years of being a
PC Windows/Linux guy got a Mac and never looked back. In fact, he then
proceeded to get a few more Macs.

Their experiences and my needs for my next machine have caused me to
think seriously about getting a Mac. Then I read `this
article <http://daringfireball.net/2004/01/a_big_garage>`__ and thought
that was interesting because I want to create and produce things. If
Apple really is focusing on that segment of the market, then I should
get a Mac.
