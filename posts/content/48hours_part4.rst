We did the third showing at the `Somerville
Theatre <http://www.somervilletheatreonline.com/>`__. I have to say, I
liked being at the Brattle Theatre a lot more than I did at the
Somerville Theatre.

I would have thought it'd be the other way around since the Brattle only
has one screen and they're so artsy that you'd think they'd get into
this "we're artsy and above all that non-art riff-raff" but they don't.
The people were way cool and helpful and the place itself was easy to do
our thing in.

The Somerville Theatre people, on the other hand, were just basically
unhelpful. I get this feeling they hate working there--it's hard to say
though. S remarked that it must be a job requirement that they're not
allowed to smile. Ever. It's interesting to note they have a Good Humor
vending machine in their lobby.

Anyhow, things went as they tend to go. It's really wild watching these
people who participated watching the products of their weekends. Some
are excited and really liked what they created. Others just hate it all.
Some wax on about whose fault all the problems were.

It's interesting to note that almost all of the groups so far used a
variation of Final Cut Express or Final Cut Pro on a Mac. It's also
interesting to note that Avid was one of the sponsors of the 48 hour
film project.
