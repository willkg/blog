The work we were having done to the new house is done, we moved in, and
we're settling down now. S wanted a couple of rooms painted, so I and a
handful of awesome people did that over the weekend. The living room is
set up (we can finally sit on the couches) and I've started
bootstrapping the office. That means I can finally get some serious work
done.

We're outside of Boston now. If you're in the area and want to
hang out, I'm definitely game. I haven't done any research to see what
groups are in the area yet, so if you know Linux, Python, Miro, FSF, or
other kinds of groups, I'd be interested.
