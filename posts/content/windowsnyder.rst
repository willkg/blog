I think most people have stories about their undergrad days in Computer Science
where they were hooked up to an intervenous drip of caffeine and staying up all
hours of the night wrangling with assembler on a robot that had lasers for eyes
and could do backflips down the hall and land on both feet while juggling C
pointers and doing remote garbage collection ...  And most of the stories from
these days are essentially myths and the characters of those stories are like
Greek heroes and heroines.

One of those people from my undergrad days was Window Snyder.  She was just the
awesome of the awesome.  She had a VAX machine for a coffee table.  As I
recall, she dropped out because she was involved in some clandestine project
somewhere that involved all kinds of stuff that so boggled my mind at the time
that I don't even remember a hint of it.

Gary told me that she's now the head of security strategy at Mozilla.  Sure
enough, she even has her own `wiki page <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_Snyder>`_.
