I dislike doing my taxes because I'm paranoid that I'm going to do them
wrong and the government is going to assume I'm an evil person is going
to beat the crap out of me. So the first days of spring are tainted with
that foul wind of tax season.

This year I received an immense amount of immensely useful help from my
brother who seems to really have a handle on the tax thing. Also I
switched from using TurboTax to Tax-Engine. Tax-Engine is easier on my
browser, but I'm not sure it really helped me much in the long run.

Regardless, it's done and I can move on.
