On Friday, I sat down at my desk at work, put my coffee mug down, and
went to scratch my eyebrow when suddenly the lens fell out of my glasses
and the tiniest screw in the universe dropped almost unnoticeably to the
desk in a beautiful swan dive. This surprised me greatly and led to
three different epiphanies:

#. **It's hard to fix your glasses when you can't use your glasses
   because they need fixing.**
#. **When a jewelers screwdriver isn't handy, a paperclip can do--but
   poorly.** For some reason no one has a jewelers screwdriver handy
   which is a shame. All mine were at home and I was at the office. I
   was able to screw the tiniest screw ever using the edge of a
   paperclip while squinting so much I was in that funky limbo between
   where I couldn't see because I wasn't wearing my glasses and I
   couldn't see because I was squinting so much trying to adjust for not
   wearing my glasses because that's what I was trying to fix. Anyhow, I
   fixed it enough that I was able to get home.
#. **When you ask someone for a jewelers screwdriver (which they don't
   have) they show you all the stuff they do have which might (but
   really doesn't) suffice.** People have a lot of weird stuff at work.

Anyhow, I was amused to discover that `Ted also had vision
problems <http://www.sauria.com/blog/2004/02/07#809>`__. We're like
TWINS!!!

I got home today and totally forgot to fix my glasses until I had been
sitting here for 10 minutes staring at this weird bug I found (or
thought I found) in PyBlosxom that was happening in one of my blogs but
not the other. The PATH_INFO for the url http://blog/george/sophia
showed up (incorrectly) as "/blog/george/sophia.txt" and for the other
showed up (correctly) as "/blog/george/sophia" Both blogs were
configured almost identically, so I was perplexed. Then I realized that
it was just me doing something silly. That's when I remembered
that I had to fix my glasses. So I pulled out one of my jewelers
screwdriver kit (I have several--one of which I should bring to the
office) and pulled out a perfect screwdriver, fixed my glasses and
marvelled at how a screwdriver of the right size can make all the
difference in the world.

To summarize, my glasses are fixed, I fixed my configuration, PyBlosxom
doesn't have a bizarre PATH_INFO bug, and I learned that a paperclip can
be used as a quick fix.
