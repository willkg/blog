The last 7 days have been really great. I was thinking about this last
night when it occurred to me that most of the entries on my blog as of
late have been notes from dev conference calls for work. So I decided to
write this up.

There have been several things that have made the last week great:

#. `Asheesh <http://www.asheesh.org/>`__ was hired as a contractor at
   `PCF <http://pculture.org/>`__. I'm really psyched about this. Not
   just because I think Asheesh is my personal messiah and will solve
   all my non-family-life problems, but also because he's a great
   developer, a great person, and a great communicator. I have a lot to
   learn from him. Having him work in the PCF context will make that
   learning easier. Plus he's more likely to solve my non-family-life
   problems because they'll probably bug him, too. :)
#. Morgan redid the `PCF web-site <http://pculture.org/>`__ and it's
   fantastic.
#. Verizon FIOS finally came to my area and I switched. Prior to that,
   only Comcast was available for a reasonable broadband Internet
   connection and they kind of suck. It's interesting to note that the
   most friendly and most useful customer support person I talked to was
   the one I talked to after going through their ridiculous menu system
   and ending up at "leaving Comcast" (or whatever they call it). Now,
   I've got better Internet service now for a cheaper monthly cost and
   with better hardware. Plus the Verizon technician who came to do the
   install fixed up the side of my house. Seriously.
#. My wife is 36 weeks pregnant. For reasons I don't want to go into,
   this is a big deal and it's really great.
#. I finished building my standing desk. I built it with studs and
   leftover wood from other projects. It was cheap ($30 or so), works
   great, and I really like it. I'll post pictures soon.
#. I've almost finished building the changing table. I finished staining
   it and now I'm doing a few coats of polyurethane. It looks great so
   far. I hope it works out because it took a long time to build. I also
   hope we get a few more warm days because otherwise the polyurethane
   takes a long time to dry.
#. My list of things to do before birthageddon is now trending towards
   smaller (yay!).
#. Miro 3.5 is almost done and it's looking great and I'm now using the
   conversions feature fairly regularly. I'm hoping to do the Miro 3.5
   release before the baby release, but ... they'll both come when
   they're ready.
#. I'm scheduled to play D&D (actually, it's
   `Pathfinder <http://paizo.com/pathfinder>`__) on Thursday after a two
   or three month hiatus. I have no clue what's going on in the
   campaign, but I'm sure it'll be fun. Plus we'll get to use the d20 I
   bought a few months ago that's all sparkly and pretty.

And all this happened in the last week. It's been a good week.
