Two weekends ago (June 23rd, 24th and 25th), S and I and S's parents
went up to Schenectady, NY to the `Old Songs
Festival <http://www.oldsongs.org/festival/index.html>`__. It was
fantastic! Contra dancing, Shetland fiddling, flat-picking, blues,
bluegrass, Celtic harp, ... I had a great time and the experience was
educational, inspirational, and in various ways eye-opening.

Last year at Old Songs, S's parents won a guitar. I've been playing it
on and off for a year or so now and it's got a great sound to it. It's
very different from my Guild American--I think the best way to describe
it is that it's less muddy and it's brighter. Though part of that could
be due to a need to change the strings on my Guild American.

I attended a few workshops of `Beppe
Gambetta <http://www.beppegambetta.com/>`__, a flatpicker from Genoa,
Italy. He taught one workshop on stretching and gymnastics for better
flatpicking, most of it focusing on making the left hand more agile.
Great stuff.

`Jay Mankita <http://www.jaymankita.com/>`__ had a song called `"They
Lied" <http://www.jaymankita.com/theylied.html>`__ which I've been
humming since I heard it--it's catchy.

Great experience. I'm looking forward to next year, though S said that
the festival coincides with GA, so I think we'll wait a couple years
before going again.

On a side note, I brought my Nokia 770 with several ebooks and Mahjong
on it. It was super useful.
