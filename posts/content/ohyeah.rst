There's a song entitled Oh Yeah by Yello. It's a fun song and I listen
to it sometimes when I'm in one of those awesome feeling moods where I'm
actually accomplishing things and my todo list is getting shorter as
opposed to infinitely longer. Anyhow, I was thinking of writing some of
the lyrics down and sending them via email to a friend, but when I write
it down, it's totally unrecognizable and certainly doesn't get across
the general feeling of the song.

But, hey--some songs are like that.

I wonder if folks who listen to symphony music have this problem. Do
they resort to poetical descriptions? Something like this:

    Rachmaninoff Prelude in C# minor is so beautiful--it fills my heart with
    joyous melancholy!

Do they ever text message each other?

    Yo! Rach PinCS rox!

It reminds me of this project I've had for a long time. I've always
wanted to implement a barbershop quartet on a mud. How can I
programmatically get across the difference in quality between an
experienced quartet and one that's just starting out to the audience?
That sort of thing fascinates me. Sometimes people ask me what I'm
thinking about when I'm staring off into space. I'm probably thinking
about barbershop quartets in mud-space.
