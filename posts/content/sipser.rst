I went to the Sipser colloqium today and he discussed P versus NP. I've
taken two Algorithms classes and a Theory of Computation class, too, but
I still found it really interesting especially given that Sipser wrote
the Theory of Computation book we used.

So he does this whole presentation thing and it's really interesting and
such and then he takes some questions. The last question was from a
woman who had just taken a Theory of Computation course (using his book)
and wanted to know why it should be required. I always find questions
like that curious. In this case, I'm glad I know about the things I
learned in that course. While they're more mathematical in nature than
what I'm typically used to, I think they provide an awesome grounding in
what kinds of problems are doable and what kinds of problems are
computationally difficult. While I'm not planning to continue
investigating whether P = NP or P != NP, it's really interesting to know
that they exist, what they are, and why they're really interesting.

Anyhow, long story short, it was a really interesting colloqium, I'm
glad I'm in grad school, and people who need validation for the things
they're learning beyond the knowledge itself puzzle me.
