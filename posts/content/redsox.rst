Given that it's a lunar eclipse and the Red Sox seem like they're going
to sweep the series after decades of borking in the most dramatic
possible way, I have made a few predictions about what will happen:

* A meteor (or ordinance from testing advanced government weapons) will
  hit the stadium causing injury to everyone involved thus post-poning
  the game indefinitely.
* The Red Sox will win the game, then take off their human masks--turns
  out they're aliens trying to make the point that they can play
  baseball, too. Though since they're illegal aliens, they will be sent
  to Guantanamo indefinitely with no rights and an alien mother ship
  will come down and wipe out the human race.
* The Earth will pass between the sun and the moon causing strange
  alien vibes to hit Ortiz' bionic arm. It will proceed to kill
  everyone on the team a la `Maximum
  Overdrive <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091499/>`__.

However, I'll have to find out what happened tomorrow since the
jackasses at RCN installed cable at the neighbor's place and foobar'd
our cable and internet service. Then decided they can't come back and
fix it until Thursday. Jackasses.
