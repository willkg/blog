Excitement simmered in the air of the first screening at the 
`Brattle Theatre <http://www.brattlefilm.org/>`_ like
jumping beans in a popcorn popper.

I was elected Lead Usher by the organizational committee in a
unanimous vote.  I think they were really impressed by my
platform speech which outlined my plan for total usher awesomeness [1]_.

I carried out my lead usher duties with precision--handing out ballots 
and pencils like a professional.  I had a flashlight with me 
but never used it [2]_.  I don't think I'll be bringing one tonight.
For the second show I just sat around and watched all my usher minions 
deviously performing their assigned usher duties.

I'm tired now.  I think I got home at midnight and then ate some dinner and
went to bed.


.. [1] I was the first usher to arrive--that might have helped as well.

.. [2] When I was preparing, I was envisioning one of those ushers with the
   flashlights pointing out free seats.
