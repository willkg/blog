I'm seriously looking into doing grad school starting Fall of 2005 and
getting either a Masters or a PhD in Computer Science. As such, I
started reading through the sites of schools in the area that offer that
sort of thing. The `NEU CCS <http://www.ccs.neu.edu/>`__ site is pretty
interesting. They list faculty and their research interests of which the
following piqued my interest:

* `Lieberherr <http://www.ccs.neu.edu/groups/faculty/lieber.html>`__
  and `Lorenz <http://www.ccs.neu.edu/groups/faculty/lorenz.html>`__ -
  the Demeter project, Adaptive Programming (and AOP), and dealing with
  software design issues. This is very much something I'd like to
  pursue.
* `Clinger <http://www.ccs.neu.edu/groups/faculty/will.html>`__ -
  compiler optimization for higher-order languages and nonpredictive
  generational garbage collection. This is really interesting as well.
* `Tarasewich <http://www.ccs.neu.edu/groups/faculty/tarase.html>`__ -
  bridging information systems, computer science, engineering, and
  marketing. It's similar (or at least parallel) to what I've been
  doing for the last few years and it might be interesting to pursue.
* `Wand <http://www.ccs.neu.edu/groups/faculty/wand.html>`__ -
  programming-language semantics and their application to compiler
  correctness. This is really fascinating--but I have less a priori
  knowledge and experience of this than I do for the above faculty and
  their research interests (though that's a very first-blush analysis).
* `Williams <http://www.ccs.neu.edu/groups/faculty/rjw.html>`__ -
  machine learning, a subspecialty of artificial intelligence. This is
  also really interesting.

When I was talking with the University of Phoenix folks (I tossed around
getting an MBA for a brief period of time and bumped into a UoP booth
while fetching lunch), they were pretty adamant about me answering the
question of why I want to go back to school. I think that's a little
weird. I want to go back to school because I want to flesh out my
knoweldge and experience in various areas and I think the most effective
way to do that especially in regards to Programming Language design and
theory is to go back to school. Sure, I can putz around on python-dev
and read the articles listed on LtU as I've been doing the last couple
of years, but I'd get a lot more out of getting a Masters or PhD. And I
think now is a good time in my life to do it.
