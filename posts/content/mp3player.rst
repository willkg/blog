I'm tossing around getting an mp3 player again.  My car only has a 
tape deck and the radio reception is kind of flakey for no apparent 
reason I can discern [1]_.  Also, I take the T around town frequently
and it'd be nice to have a portable device that I can listen to at
work, on my work commute, at home, on the T, and in other places.

I don't really need to upload my entire music collection.  Having
said that, I'm a mood-centric music listener and I have a bunch of
different moods and it'd be nice to have at least 10 or 20 songs
for each mood.  Thus I've tossed around getting a hard-drive
based player.

I'd rather have a player that doesn't require a fancy gui thingy on
my host computer.  Having said that, I realize those gui's are nice
since they frequently build an index of the songs on the drive, so
it makes boot up of the player <b>much</b> faster.  I <b>HATE</b> 
Creative Labs Music Center (or whatever it's called).  I've never
used iTunes.  I don't need something to categorize my life--just
something to load songs onto the mp3 player.

I don't really care about size, but I'd like the player to fit in my
pocket.  I don't care about cool-factor.  I don't care about user
interfaces as long as I can select songs to play, play them, and
skip songs I don't feel like listening to.  I don't care about playing
solitare or about organizing my life.  A remote control would be nice
but it's not necessary.

The battery has to last at least 6 hours and it's not acceptable for
it to die in a year.

I don't want to pay a fortune.  It has to be available at amazon.com.

And that's as far as I've gotten on this train of thought.  Email
willkg at bluesock dot org if you have ideas [2]_.

.. [1] I could be parked NEXT TO the WBUR tower and all I get is hiss 
   one day, but the next day it comes in just fine--heck if I know what 
   the problem is.

.. [2] I keep tossing around adding comments to my blog.  I don't think
   that many people read it and want to comment on it and I don't feel like
   dealing with comment spam.  Maybe I'll add it next week for a trial
   period to see if it works out or not.
