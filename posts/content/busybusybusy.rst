I've been super busy over the last few weeks. Between work and moving
and weddings and trying to catch up with things, I haven't had much time
to ruminate on anything or work on any of my projects.

There's one exception to that... I'm a coder on
`DarkRifts <http://www.darkrifts.org/>`__ and I've been doing some minor
refactoring and overhauls of some of the pieces of their mudlib. That's
coming along nicely. The other coders have been really kicking in and
getting things done lately. Watching the codebase flourish has been
wonderful.

I'm not entirely sure what I should do with PyBlosxom. Development has
pretty much stopped--Ted, Wari, Blake and I have all moved on to other
things (babies, other projects, ...). No one else has stepped up to the
plate. Though we keep getting emails on the dev lists and elsewhere
about how no one will use PyBlosxom unless it does feature x and feature
y and how there's lots of bad code and so on so forth. I wish more
people would help out.
