I had this 8x12 foot carpet in my car and I'm driving up to 
deliver it to S's church.  I decide it's hot so I roll down the driver-side
and passenger-side front windows.  After a few minutes, I decide I can't
hear the radio, so I'd do A/C instead.  I roll up the driver-side front
window without any problems, but the passenger-side front window just makes
clicking noises--it doesn't go up.  Ah well, I think to myself--I'll look
at it when I'm not driving.

I get off the highway and pull into a Dunkin Donuts parking
lot.  I have ...  I think you'd call it automatic windows--they're electrically
powered--so I leave the key in the ignition so I can power the window up
and down.  I wander over to the passenger-side front window, open the door, try
the button, hear the clicky noises, and then stick my fingers into the door
and pull the window up manually.  That works out well and the window has
enough friction to stay up as long as I don't touch the up/down button.

Smiling, I shut the door.  Then I wander over to the driver-side to get
my key out of the ignition and discover...  that my car has locked itself!

So there I am in the Dunkin Donuts parking lot with my keys in the ignition and
my car locked. I feel really foolish now--a radical contrast to the incredibly
smart feeling I was just feeling after doing something incredibly smart.  Then
it occurs to me that my window is broken so I wander back to the
passenger-side, manually pull down the window, grab my keys from the inside,
stick my fingers in the door and pull the window back up again.

Then I decided to try a local mechanic rather than the VW dealership in
Brighton who, while they have free coffee and they seem very nice, tends to be
expensive and far away and irritating to schedule appointments with.  I looked
at the `CarTalk web-site <https://www.cartalk.com/>`__ and found a mechanic a
mile and a half from me, called them up, and had the window fixed the next day.
I thought they added the total up wrong because it was impossibly low--but it
turns out that was the price.
