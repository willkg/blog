I'm heading to Portland, OR for `OSCON
2008 <http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/home>`__ to help
man the Mozilla booth at the Expo. I registered as an Expo attendee, but
I'll be there (or near there) from the 19th through the 26th.

My primary purpose there is as a representative for
`Miro <http://getmiro.com/>`__ and talking to people about it. However,
I'm also interested in meeting up with people working on:

* PyBlosxom things
* Miro and video podcasting things
* Python 2.6/3.0 testing, documentation, bug-fixing, ... things

If you're interested, too, ping me. I'm hanging out on the ``#oscon``
channel on irc.freenode.net and you can always get me by email or
comments below.
