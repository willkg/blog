I think the reason some people buy houses is because they're just sick
to death of moving. I know I'm very soon going to become one of these
people... well, maybe in a year or so.

I've only hired movers for two moves: going from NH to CA and going from
CA to MA. In both cases, the cost of shipping the stuff was so large
that adding in a bunch of big hefty guys packing everything up and
moving it down a million flights of stairs into a truck parked miles
away was barely .001% of the cost.

For every other move (and I've moved a lot over the last 10 or so
years), I've moved myself with the help of friends and family. Every
time, I've used muscles I didn't know I had and gotten bruises the size
of small third world nations in places I didn't think could bruise.
It was nuts!

This time I vow not to get any new stuff and to give away half of the
stuff I have! I swear I'm going to do it this time!
