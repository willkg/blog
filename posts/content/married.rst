I've been married for a little over a week and it's really great!

Our wedding went off fantastically!  The photobooks I made using
`Tabblo <http://www.tabblo.com/>`_ evoked amazement from
most people who looked at them.  The cakes we made came out great
with little sugar bees flying around on top.  
`Creative Catering <http://www.creative-catering.com/>`_,
our caterer, was amazing and the food was some of the best food I've 
ever had at a wedding.  During the reception we had New England 
style contra-dancing.  Even though it was very warm, many guests
participated and it was a lot of fun!

It was really great to see people, but ...  I didn't have enough
time to get to talk with everyone.  I don't think S did either.
I think that's my only regret--we'll have to throw another big
party next year.

The day after the wedding, S and I went to S' parents' house for a 
brunch then off to Cape Cod where we bumped around for a few
days amidst glorious weather.

I'm still fiddling with my ring.  I think that'll take a bit of 
getting used to because it gets sticky and then feels weird.

Wedding planning was nuts and while there are a zillion guides and
articles filled with pictures of blushing brides and cakes that are 
built like a Scottish castle none of the ones I saw use project 
management techniques.  I figured while it's all fresh in my mind, 
I'll sketch something out and at least hit all the big issues that, 
had we known earlier, would have made it a lot easier and more 
straight-forward.
