So I used to be an E2 noder way back and then didn't really have anything
to node anymore so I stopped.  One of the things I noded was
`Tom Lehrer <http://www.everything2.org/index.pl?node_id=557738>`_.
I did that way back in 2000--almost 3 years ago.  My friend sends me an im
today with `this <http://www.tom.lehrer.com-music.homepages.org/>`_.
Funnily enough, it's identical to what I wrote--the dude stole the links
and everything!

Weird.  Someone stole stuff I wrote and then built a web-site out
of it.
