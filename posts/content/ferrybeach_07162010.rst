We were running out of time to cover all the material, so I made the
decision to survey the material, mention resources, and hope the
participants would pick up enough that they could continue their
learning on their own.

After looking at the evaluations, three things are clear:

#. the workshop covered a ton of stuff and everyone got something out of
   it
#. this is a tough workshop if the spectrum of experience ranges from
   beginner to experienced--it's probably better to have all the
   participants be beginners or all of them be experienced
#. there's a lot of material missing regarding structuring policies that
   cover privacy, data availability, confidentiality, child safety, and
   other things like that--it's not enough to cover tools and how they
   can be useful, it's imperative to cover the policy context in which
   they can be reponsibly used

One thing that surprised me is that no one is really that interested in
blogging. Blogging is such a rich form of communication and the
interconnectedness of blogs creates a network of knowledge and
experience--I must not have effectively communicated that.

Anyhow, the workshop is over. I'm glad I did it--I had a great time and
it was a learning experience for me as well. Feel free to email me for a
link to the workshop materials.
