There's a new Google Talk version; they added pictures and some other
stuff. But in doing that they changed it so that it whacks all
indentation. So copy and pasting code snippets to people doesn't work as
well becase all the preceeding white space in each line is removed. That
makes it infinitely less useful for me and pretty irksome.
