Turned 36 over the weekend. It's weird---the number keeps getting bigger
but I still feel like me. I'm somewhat bummed I haven't achieved more by
now, but so it goes.

Sobering thought: This is the last square until 49.

My brother brought up this cake last night. I always liked how Ned posted
pictures of his family's cakes. This is probably not a cake his family would
have made, but so it goes:

   Cake!


It seems rude, but I find it really funny and I have a kid, so it's
technically true.
