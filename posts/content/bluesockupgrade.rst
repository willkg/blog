I decided that one of the things I would do during "winter break" was to
upgrade the hardware that bluesock.org sits on. There were a couple of
minor issues, but otherwise the upgrade has gone very very smoothly.
This time around, I'm writing up a massive "everything about this
server" document. I think I may build a template out of it since it's
the sort of thing that would be useful for other machines I have. It's
much easier to deal with all the machines when I have an accounting of
what went into them.

Anyhow, bluesock.org now has twice the oomph. Unfortunately, "upgrade
bluesock" took several days to do, but it was only a single item in my
todo list of around 25 items. I need to start adding items like "pat
yourself on the back" and "take a nap" to my todo list--items that don't
take too long to do and aren't as torturous when you look at a list of
25 of them.
