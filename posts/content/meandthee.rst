S and her parents work at the Me and Thee Coffeehouse in Marblehead, MA
(it's 30-45 minutes from Boston depending on how you go).  I go every
now and then and catch the shows I find interesting.  There are
a few venues in the Boston area that have a solid concert list and
Me and Thee is one of them.  For example, in the next few months they
have `Ellis Paul <http://www.ellispaul.com/>`_,
`Antje Duvekot <http://www.antjeduvekot.com/>`_, and
`Lucy Kaplansky <"http://www.lucykaplansky.com/>`_.

Definitely worth checking the concert schedule to see if there are
upcoming shows you might be interested in.  It's a great venue and
when J is there, they have amazingly decadent cookies.
