I'm currently working for ByAllAccounts and I've been here for 15 months
now. It's an amazing company filled with a tight group of amazing
people.

Forrester did a report on the wealth aggregation space and ranked us at
the top. It's been the cause of much excitement around here. And much
deserved.
