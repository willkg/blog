I've finished my third (out of four) semester of grad school on the way
to get my Masters in Computer Science. This semester was really tough,
partially because I didn't have the experience and knowledge coming into
my classes that I needed. Even so, I learned a huge amount of stuff,
much of it immediately applicable, and ended up with an A and a B+.

I'm taking a compilers course next semester with Olin Shivers which
should be really exciting and I'm going to do a project on DAJ input
specification stuff (I still have to work out the project statement).

Between now and next semester, I've got a boatload of stuff to do. I'm
going to catch up on PyBlosxom, help Ryan with the contributed plugins
(and comments), work with Lance to get the documentation updated, and
hopefully release a version of PyBlosxom that is a radical improvement
in the maturity of the project code, infrastructure, and process.

It'll be a busy month....
