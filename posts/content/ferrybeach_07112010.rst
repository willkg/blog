Today was the introduction to the workshop. We had a hell of a time with
the Internet connection, though, so that caused the activity not to work
so well and was pretty frustrating.

I talked to Dan about it afterwards and we devised some alternatives for
the rest of the week--it's hard to do a workshop on using social media
if the Internet connection isn't reliable.

I spent the rest of the day talking to people and working on the
workshop.
