It turns out my internet connection was sucking for a week because evil
ninja squirrels ate the cable that goes from the telephone pole to the
building my apartment is in and then the cable filled with water. Who
knew evil ninja squirrels were such a threat to my bottom line?!

The technician replaced the line using an 18' ladder precariously parked
in the middle of the semi-busy street in 20 minutes. The frosting on the
cake was when he came inside and said, "Yeah, so squirrels chewed on the
line and then it filled with water. There's nothing we can do about that
because we can't kill all the squirrels."
