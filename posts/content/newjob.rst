It's been a chaotic few months... I worked a lot the last two weeks of
grad school, got my Masters, got married, went on a honey moon (or
toffee moon depending on where you live), pushed out a new version of
PyBlosxom, and ... got a job! I'll be a developer on the Democracy
Player (soon to be Miro) at `Participatory
Culture <http://www.pculture.org/>`__.

I'm really psyched about this. Hopefully it nicely weds my Open
Source/Free Software development hobbies with employment. Hopefully it
nicely weds the way I like doing software development with the way I
have to do it for work. Regardless, it's nice to be working in one major
language (Python) rather than two (Java and Python). Also, there's a lot
of really neat technology that PCF is using that I haven't worked with
before--so it'll definitely be a growing experience.

I start next Monday (July 16th). Because I'll be doing Python
development for employment, it'll be a lot easier to focus on
Python-oriented things and blog more about Python the language, tools,
methodologies and all that, too.
