I had a splendid weekend with S's parents and then bumping around
Harvard Square on Sunday. I did some studying for the GRE, but mostly
took a couple of days off from doing work.

I also finished up overhauling all the code on DarkRifts to work with
the MudOS v.22.2b14 driver. There's a huge amount of code and there were
a lot of problems most of which are sorted out now. There are still a
few problems, but no one seems to be logging in, so I don't really feel
any urgency to work through the last bits.

I'm planning on pushing pyblosxom through to a 1.1 release soon. First,
I'm going to package up the flavour files into flavour packs for the
registry. Second, I'm going to add documentation to all the contributed
plugins and move them all to the registry. Accomplishing those two tasks
should give the code in CVS enough time to bake. Then we'll do a 1.1
release and start thinking about 1.2 which will likely involve a minor
overhaul to how we pull files from the file system.

The next two weeks will be pretty busy. Already I'm way behind in
replying to email.
