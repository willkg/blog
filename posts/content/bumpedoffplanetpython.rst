I used to be subscribed to Unnoficial Planet Python
(http://www.planetpython.org/) but for some reason, I was unsubscribed.
I didn't get any email about it, so I'm not sure what the problem was. I
emailed Ryan (his email address is on the site) twice and haven't heard
anything.

I am still subscribed to Planet Python (http://planet.python.org/), so
I'm puzzled.

This is a minor issue because I'm not subscribed many places (subscribed
is probably not the right word to use), so it reduces my audience
significantly and prevents me from participating as much as I could be
[1]_.

Anyhow, if anyone knows of a better way to get me re-subscribed to the
Unofficial Planet Python, that'd be super.

.. [1] Since I've been in grad school, my blog has been quiet-ish but
   that ends in May.

**Updates:**

01/11/2007 Ryan got in touch with me and I'm back on again. w00t!
