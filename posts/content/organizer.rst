My cell phone is doing things that are reminiscent of a small furry
woodland creature in the throes of death. It even makes the same noises,
though my phone makes the noises in a highly non-reproducable and
intermittent sort of way. Thus, I've been tossing around getting a new
cell phone in the near future. That's the first problem.

Along comes problem two: my schedule went from this easy-to-manage
one-or-two-things-to-do-a-week to a massive stack of errands and events
that I honestly can't come to grips with short of getting a helping
hand. I tossed around getting another Palm Pilot or similar device and
then decided I should replace my phone and get a Treo 600 `(buy at
Amazon) <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000SX2U2/bluesockorg-20/103-9730330-2087008>`__
because they're waaay cool.

I tossed this around for a week and then ended up deciding to punt on
the phone issue until it actually dies and getting a paper organizer
that fits in my pocket.

The biggest reason I got a paper organizer and not a PDA (that's
"personal digital assistant" and not "public display of affection" in
this context for those who are wondering) is that I want *less*
gadgets in my life. Every time I add a gadget to the arsenel, it adds to
the total amount of time I'm spending maintaining and fixing things not
to mention the huge chunk of time it takes to get the things to work
with all the other things I own. This is definitely a case where less is
more and more is less.
