I just found out that `Stargate
SG-1 <http://gateworld.net/news/2006/08/istargate_sg-1i_cancelled_iatlan.shtml>`__
was cancelled and this is its final season. That really bums me out. I
thoroughly enjoyed the series and it's one of two shows that S and I
keep up with (the other being Stargate Atlantis--though I also watch
Battlestar Galactica).

I realize that all things end eventually, but I've spent a good part of
the last 4 or 5 years watching SG-1 episodes and thinking about the
various predicaments they've been in. It's a great science fiction show
on at a time when most shows are sitcoms and reality tv shows.

Anyhow, I'm bummed. It's irritating when companies cancel good shows
because of results that are as likely to be results of poor business
decisions than a poor show no one is interested in. I very much look
forward to the time when more "tv shows" are less like they are now and
more like vlogs which I can enjoy during downtime when it fits my
schedule.
