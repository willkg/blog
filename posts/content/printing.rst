I was printing out the 1,203,481,288 pages involved in my tax return on
my HP OfficeJet Series 700 printer which I got from my uncle a million
years ago back when printers would print one dot at a time and it
sounded like disco music, when suddenly an error message pops up saying
in really big letters:

::

    PRINTER ERROR

    The computer has lost communication with the printer.

    Cancel printing, turn the printer off, then back on, do the hokey pokey,
    burn incense, twirl three times, tap your heels together and then
    try printing again.

I'm skeptical of stuff like that. I'm a programmer--I'm fully aware that
computers and software have no clue what they're doing. My printer was
still printing the pages--albeit so incredibly slow that a three-toed
sloth would start getting impatient. I figured I'd wait until the
printer was done doing whatever it was doing.

I came back 24 days later to discover everything printed out just fine.
And in color--I had no clue this was a color printer!

I still don't know what that error was all about. Maybe the software
didn't expect the printer to take so damned long? Who knows? Regardless,
I'm done filing my taxes, it's 60 degrees outside, and I'm going to go
get some breakfast.
