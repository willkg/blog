I do a lot of Linux development and most of my projects involve
Linux, GNU software, Python, PHP, Apache and a variety of other 
Open Source software components.  Naturally, this whole SCO thing
has been somewhat of a surprise and originally made me hesitant
since it brought up a series of questions I didn't really know
the answers to.

So this whole SCO thing has been a very nice learning experience
for me.  I imagine it's been a very nice learning experience for
many other people as well.  Things like, "How can an Open Source
project prevent copyright violations?" and "What are the legal 
ramifications of using software that doesn't come with a warranty
for possible legal issues?" are being explained in very public
forums--things that pockets of the Open Source community have known
for many years, but which may not have been as obvious to the rest
of us.

As time has gone on and SCO continues to make press releases
indicating that either they are incredibly intelligent and are
playing some kind of really funky publicity game or that they
have no clue what they're talking about and are learning alongside
some of the rest of us, various members and groups of the Open 
Source community (which is so large in numbers and varied in 
philosophies, motivations, backgrounds, worldviews, religions, ethnic
backgrounds, programming backgrounds, favorite colors, spoken language,
geography, vocation and such we might as well say "people on planet 
Earth") have responded in an increasingly comprehensive manner.

The most comprehensive article on the topic is 
`this response <http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=11663>`_
to Darl McBride's most recent open letter to the community.  I would
posit that any C*O/person who reads that article will no longer have
doubts as to the extraordinary benefits of the Open Source development
model as it applies to due diligence, copyright/patent/trademark laws,
and freedom.

Where I once was hesitant about various aspects of the Open Source
development model, I no longer have doubts that it is a 
valid model and will be around for many years to come regardless
of who is poo-pooing it in the press this week.
