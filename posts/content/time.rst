I've spent the last month and a half going on vacations, moving, and
trying to get some of the big issues I've been sitting on for some time
out of the way.

The vacations have been nice, but they're kind of hard and
here's why: when I go on vacation, the work I have to do still has to
get done.  Some of it is time-sensitive, so I still have to get it done
by the deadline.  Some of it is work that involves a lot of time and it's
easier to chip away at it bit by bit, day by day than to take it on in
a couple of massive chunks.

Moving is hard, too.  It's compounded by the fact that I 
seem to find really good reasons for moving every 9-12 months.  Course,
that's a lot better than the period just after college where I was moving
on average every 3-4 months.  I dislike moving.

In terms of big issues, I finally sold my car for a song (their song--not
mine, which sucked) so that's one thing out of the way.  I also (during
the packing process) discovered my *Black Adder's Christmas Carol*
tape and my visor cd thingy with cd's in it that had gone missing for
some time.  I still haven't located my *The Good, The Bad, The Ugly*
soundtrack cd, though, and that's irritating.

Anyhow, things are getting settled--more time for coding and projects
and things.  :)
