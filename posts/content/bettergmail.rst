I read on
`Voidspace <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/arch_d7_2007_08_25.shtml#e812>`__
about `Better
Gmail <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4866>`__ and
figured I'd give it a try. It fixes one of the things I dislike about
Gmail: lack of fixed width font on messages. I've gotten used to or
around the other things I'm not wildly excited about, but lack of fixed
width font when viewing messages is such a pain in the ass. Bugzilla
emails come in and they're all screwy, emails from my stock broker come
in and they're all screwy, emails from other people that involve
text-based tables... they're all screwy, too.

Anyhow, Better Gmail has a Fixed Font option and it's awesome. I don't
understand why the Gmail folks haven't added a fixed width font option
to Gmail yet.
