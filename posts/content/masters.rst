Two years of classes and work are over [1]_ and I have a Masters 
in Computer Science [2]_.  They asked me what I focused in, but 
I'm not entirely sure.  The classes I took fall into the Software
Engineering category and also in the Programming Languages category.  I
think I ended up with a Masters in CS focusing on Programming Languages.

It was a fantastic experience and I'm twice as able as I used to be.  I
learned Scheme and SML, Adaptive programming and aspect-oriented programming,
XML Schema and XPath 2.0 (to some degree), structure-shy development and
compiler technology, operational semantics and denotational semantics
(though I'm still kind of iffy on the denotational kind), functional
programming and LaTeX, and I was able to go to a bunch of really neat 
seminars and hang out with a group of exceptional people.

I'm really glad I took the two years off to go back to school.  I didn't
expect it to pay off so greatly.

.. [1] Technically I don't have it yet, but I will this weekend assuming
   all goes well which I no reason to believe that it won't.

.. [2] While I'm done with everything that is to be graded, I'm still working
   on finishing up two papers for my research project.  I imagine that'll take
   me a while longer to do.
