So on Friday (or Thursday--I forget) I bowed out of the SillyCS mailing
list--a list I helped to start back in 1996 or so when we were all happy
Computer Science majors at Boston College. People have approached me as
to why I did such a thing. I just became less and less interested and it
was less and less fun for me.

I think part of the problem was that the SillyCS went one way but I
wanted it to go another. Case in point--it was Silly\ **CS** not
Silly\ **SPORTS**.

Anyhow, for nostalgic reasons, I post the following excerpts of the
SillyCS mythos from way back in the day:

* `Rose Quartz and the 7 Dwarves </sillycs/roseq.html>`__
* `SillyCS FAQ </sillycs/csfaq.html>`__
* `The first episode of the We Never Learn People's
  Front </sillycs/darkrrom.html>`__
* `The second episode of the We Never Learn People's
  Front </sillycs/darkrrom2.html>`__
* `The Pirates of the C Chanty (verses 1-3) </sillycs/chanty.html>`__
