I started grad school last week. The last few weeks have been pretty
work-intensive as I squared away a lot of stuff so I didn't have to
worry about it while I'm studying.

Also, bluesock suffered a hard drive failure and that took a few days to
sort out.

I haven't finished the things I wanted to finish with PyBlosxom. I have
been doing some research on
`Leonardo <http://www.jtauber.com/leonardo>`__ to see what sorts of
things we can do to make installation, configuration, and extending
PyBlosxom easier.

One thing I've been thinking about a lot is the current state of
PyBlosxom plugins. I'm not as psyched about splitting plugins off into a
separate project anymore. Lyntin had a core set of plugins that came
with Lyntin and formed most of the functionality. Then users could add
additional plugins if they so desired on a user-by-user basis. I think
it's prudent to do the same thing with PyBlosxom. I think this will help
the typical PyBlosxom installation. I'm not sure why I didn't think of
this 8 months ago or so. I'd like to do this work for PyBlosxom 1.3.
