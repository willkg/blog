Over the last 4 or 5 years I've been telling people that I'm looking to
get my masters--but I never really found a good break-point in life
stuff to actually go get my masters.  Thus it is with some excitement
that I've now gone and completed the first step: I've signed up to take 
the GRE General exam.

Where this will go--only time will tell.

On a complete irrelevant side note, it's interesting to note that I
can type paragraph tags ( <p> ... </p> ) with my right
hand while my left hand aimlessly scratches my back.
