Wari has been noticing some scaling issues with entries.  Of course, I
don't notice anything like that since I only have like 73 entries (as
of the time of this writing).  So I hereby commence my effort to create
oodles of useless chatter in order to better test out PyBlosxom.  I 
will call this **Project Content**.  All such chatter will go into
the content category.

I highly suggest using the categories on the right side thing there
to help in discerning the silly filler from the real content.  You know.
Important things like Lyntin status (3.3--working on 4.0).

The title of this entry comes from this funny story in college.  This 
dude was in the DEClab with us and we're all quietly typing away working
on whatever it is we were working on.  Then he stands up all of a 
sudden and slams his hand on the desk (WHACK!) and says in this thick
accent, "NEEEDS MORRRE MEMOREEE!"

It doesn't look so funny written down but my friend Chris does this
imitation of it that's got to be criminal.  Hilarity ensues.
