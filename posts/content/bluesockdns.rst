I moved bluesock.org from Network Solutions to
`Gandi.net <http://gandi.net/>`__ a couple of months ago. The next step
was to move the DNS records from Peer1/ServerBeach to Gandi.net. I did
that today.

I screwed up one of the records in the process and my brother let me
know he was having some issues. I think it's all straightened out now,
though, and that the current set of records are correct. However, if
you're having problems with bluesock.org related domains, let me know.

The next step is to migrate the server from Peer1/ServerBeach where I
pay $99 a month to `Asheesh <http://www.asheesh.org/>`__'s VPS in
Minnesota where I'll pay a *lot* less and I'll be able to do IRC stuff
which is forbidden on Peer1/ServerBeach. Soon! Very soon!
