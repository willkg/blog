There's a great interview with Craig of Craigslist
`here <http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.09/craigslist.html?tw=wn_tophead_7>`__
at Wired Magazine. I have to say that after reading the interview, I'm
really psyched the guy exists. From a selfish perspective, Craigslist is
the glue that binds huge parts of my life and makes certain things
infinitely easier to do. Through it I've met other people (like, for
example, my current girlfriend who used Craigslist to find the room my
brother used to live in); I've bought and sold stuff; I've done research
on stuff; friends have bought furniture and advertised venues; ... He
has single-handedly affected my life in great positive ways.

Anyhow, so I really like Craigslist and really appreciate that it's
there. It provides community for us folks who move around a lot and
don't have contacts and friends everywhere. It's a great service to
people.

Having said all that, I'm filled with trepidation. I'm afraid that even
though he's said all these wonderful things and I've never seen evidence
that the things he's said in this interview are false, I can't bring
myself to believe the statements. I half expect him to sell the shares
anyhow. If everything Craig said is true--both today and tomorrow--then
he is definitely the exception and not the rule.
