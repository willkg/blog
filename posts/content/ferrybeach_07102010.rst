S and I are taking a "working vacation" this week. We're both at Ferry
Beach in Maine and teaching workshops. Her workshop is one of the UU RE
Renaissance modules--one on worship. My workshop is on using social
media tools to run a RE program.

The `UUA <http://uua.org/>`__ has a bunch of resources on using social
media, but it's primarily focused on marketing, public relations, and
announcements. That's great stuff, but the bigger impact for social
media tools on RE programs is their ability to help people communicate,
coordinate, and collaborate with communities of volunteers. I've never
run an RE program, but I am involved in and run FLOSS
communities--there's a lot of overlap between these two domains.

As such, I'm writing my own workshop. I spent most of last week banging
out the material based on six months or so of notes and research. It's
really coming together, but I still have a lot of work to do. I have
full confidence that I can pull this off, though. At worst, I'll wing a
few of the sections and codify them into workshop materials after the
fact possibly with the help of my participants.

I checked in today and went to the Gardiner porch where I'm running the
workshop to test out the Internet connection. It was awful about an hour
ago (latency > 700ms); seems a bit better now. I'm hoping it's working
well for the workshop hours since I've lined up a bunch of demos and
activities.

After I'm done the workshop, I plan to post the materials online
licensed under a Creative Commons license. This is going to be an
awesome workshop. I dare to say that the information in this workshop
will make a huge difference running an RE program and making sense of
the chaotic landscape of social media.
