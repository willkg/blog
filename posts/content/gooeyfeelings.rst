I just finished released Lyntin 3.0 (there's another blog entry on that
specifically) and I'm all excited now! This is the first time that I've
guided a non-trivial project from start to finish where I had a hand in
everything--documentation, site development, architecture, feature
design, bug fixing, testing, development, working with other developers,
answering user issues, ... 15,000 lines of code.

Anyhow, on to other projects for a while as people pick up Lyntin and
the community grows a bit. I've set out to do everything I wanted to get
done. I still have some things in my roadmap to work on, but they can
wait.

On to Stringbean and the dozen or so other projects that are waiting in
the eves!
