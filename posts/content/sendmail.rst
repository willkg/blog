It's true. Take for example this morning when I upgraded sendmail
innocently on my server only to discover a bunch of things suddenly
stopped working. Some of the things were things I didn't even know
people were using.

Hours of tailing the maillog and poking around the sendmail site, I
discovered all kinds of exciting stuff about configuring sendmail for
smtp authentication that I didn't know about.

Every time I upgrade Apache, I learn all kinds of new things as well.
The only thing I wished, is that it wasn't quite so trial-by-fire. Of
course, for that to be the case, I would have to know everything and
there's a whole lot of stuff out there that I'd rather learn posteriori
rather than a priori. Otherwise, I'd just spend all my time studying
things I would never have time to use.
