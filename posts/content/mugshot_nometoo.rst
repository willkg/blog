I decided that it's silly for Mugshot to notify me with notification
balloon things of what I'm doing given that I already know what I'm
doing because I'm the one doing it [1]_. I thought about this for
a bit and I can understand why other people might want to be notified of
the things they're doing if only because it allows you to quip and other
social-connection things. However, when I'm flipping through tracks in
Rhythmbox to find something that fits my mood, I get a bunch of
notifications and it's kind of silly.

I signed up for a Mugshot bugzilla account and was all ready to submit a
bug detailing how while it's nice for Mugshot to tell me what I'm doing,
I'd rather it didn't. As I'm writing up the bug report, it occurs to me
that I might be able to disable it. I clicked on the Mugshot face,
clicked on the filter button, and discovered I can filter out
notifications of my events.

That's what I did instead of working on the LaTeX markup for a table
mapping XML Schema terms/ideas to Demeter class dictionary terms/ideas.

.. [1] If I don't know what I'm doing, then I probably have other more
   pressing problems to deal with.
