I got an email from `Carol Spears <http://carol.gimp.org/>`_ that caused me
to take a day off to re-organize and relax a bit.

Anyhow, so no work for me today.  I'm just going to clean out my email 
inbox, clean off my desk, figure out where I am with bills, do the dishes,
and stuff like that.  Maybe if I get really excited, I'll go grocery
shopping.

I did spend a couple of minutes to update my blog to the most recent 
PyBlosxom in CVS.  Thus I now have an `ATOM 1.0 feed 
<http://www.bluesock.org/~willkg/blog/index.atom>`_
which seems to be working nicely.  I'll look into the RSS 2.0 feed
next, but that requires some planning because I don't want to hose
any of the Planet feeds I'm on when I switch from the rss2renderer
plugin to the native RSS 2.0 feed.

**Updates:**

April 7th, 2021: The feed is now at: https://bluesock.org/~willkg/blog/rss.xml
