Shelby from the `UUA <https://uua.org/>`__ talked about using social
media for outreach, Facebook, Facebook pages vs. groups, Twitter, child
safety issues, and a variety of other important things. She also covered
what resources the UUA has for churches and RE programs.

It was a really great session.

After it, I decided to retool the rest of the workshop to follow
Shelby's flow. I think it really reached the participants plus I think
it's the best model for maximizing the usefulness of the workshop for
everyone involved.

I also decided to stop using social media presentation tools. I find
them pretty silly looking and the interfaces are kind of irritating. I
want to type a bunch of text and put the text in specific places. I
don't want to fiddle with my presentation as if it were a page layout
problem. Ugh. Anyhow, I'm now using
`s5 <https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/>`__ which I love because it's
easy to use and portable.
