Things don't seem to click in the early morning.  I know they should click
because I remember them clicking yesterday.  The early morning mental fog needs
some time to roll away...  to drift off into the corners of my mind so I can
get something done today.  It may come again tomorrow.  Such is the
way of things.

As my early morning mental fog is doing its early morning mental fog
drifting, I usually get a cup of coffee or tea, sit bleary-eyed while reading
through email, and then count the number of things in my todo list and divide
by 10.  I use that number to figure out early on whether I'm going to be
measurably productive or whether it's just going to be one of those days where
I spin my wheels a lot and don't really get anywhere.
