Work has been pretty busy. I've been doing release manager stuff,
working on Gutsy packaging issues, puzzling over an intermittent problem
between the ``sun-java6-plugin`` and Miro, working on a Firefox
extension, and working on a patch for Firefox 3.0.

I went to some of the after-hours activities for the `GNOME Summit
Boston <http://live.gnome.org/Boston2007>`__. I'm going to `PodCamp
Boston <http://podcamp.pbwiki.com/PodCampBoston2>`__ this weekend.

I was writing my todo list management application in
`Django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`__, but then decided to switch
it to `Pylons <http://pylonshq.com/>`__. Now I'm thinking I may just go
a much easier route and implement it in `web.py <http://webpy.org/>`__.
A year ago, I wrote a wiki system that was code-friendly using web.py in
three hours which included the amount of time it took to learn how
web.py worked.

`PyBlosxom <http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/>`__ work for version 2.0
has slowed considerably. I just haven't had much time to spend on it. A
bunch of us are hanging out in ``#pyblosxom`` on ``irc.freenode.net``
and we're talking about things more often. I met
`paulproteus <http://www.asheesh.org/>`__ in real life during the GNOME
Summit Boston. I'm trying to figure out how to create multi-page output
using `docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`__. There was some
development in that arena over the summer, some of it due to a `GSoC
project <http://code.google.com/soc/2007/psf/appinfo.html?csaid=8D04C53750906F50>`__.
I need to spend some more time to figure out what's available now in
SVN, how to use it, and whether it'll fix my problem.

I've upgraded all my machines to Gutsy. It's nice--the fonts seem to be
much easier to read on both my laptop and my desktop with an LCD.

That about covers it. It's been a low-Python high-JavaScript month.
