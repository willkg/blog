* Don't email anything to anyone that you wouldn't mind reading out
  loud 10 years down the road to everyone on Earth.
* Don't write a journal entry, paper, or other item published on the
  Internet that you wouldn't mind reading out loud 10 years down the
  road to everyone on Earth.
* Don't put up photos that you wouldn't mind showing in a very large
  slide show 10 years down the road to everyone on Earth.
* Double check everything you publish on the Internet BEFORE you
  publish it.
* Don't make jokes about your relatives--they could be computer
  illiterate but someone from work could tell them.

If you want to do these things, write them in a private journal. You
know--one of those paper kind.
