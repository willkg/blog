I've been cutting my own hair since like 1991 or so with two exceptions:
a professional haircut before my wedding and one before my wife's sister's
wedding.

Back in 1991, my parents bought me a set of Wahl clippers. Over the years,
I broke two of the combs and a few of the extensions. Plus it has a crack
down the side of the plastic body. At one point, I was cutting hair for
a bunch of people on my dorm floor in college. It's seen a lot of use in
23 years.

However, a month ago, it started shorting the circuit. There's a loose wire
or frayed something or something something. Between that and the crack down
the side of the plastic body, I figured it's time to retire them and get a
new set. The new set arrived today.

23 years is a long time. I have very few things that I've had for a long time.
I bought my bicycle in 1992 or so. I have a clock radio I got in the mid-80s.
I have a solar powered calculator from 1990 or so (TI-36). Everything else
seems to fail within 5 years: blenders, toaster ovens, rice cookers, drills,
computers, etc.

I'll miss those clippers. I hope the new ones last as long.
