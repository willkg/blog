`This <http://www-static.cc.gatech.edu/~shivers/autoweapons.html>`__ was
floating around on
`programming.reddit.com <http://programming.reddit.com>`__ and I finally
decided to see what it was all about because I wasn't getting very far
with register allocation and needed a break. I click on the link, start
reading about guns and ammo and then... I see ``Olin.Shivers@h``... Gah!
That's my professor!

Then I broke into a sweat and went back to work on register allocation
and graph coloring [1]_.

.. [1] Actually, what really happened is that I took a break, read that
   page, exclaimed, "Gah! That's my professor!", then broke into a sweat,
   *then wrote a blog entry about it*, and now I'm going back to working on
   register allocation.
