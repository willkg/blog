After work, I went to my car with the full expectation that I was going to
hop into it and drive home.  Alas, such was not the case!  There was
this bulge in the sidewall of my front driver-side tire.  The bulge was
the size of Kansas, so I thought it prudent not to drive on it.  I look
in my trunk and notice my spare is flat (again).  It has this really 
really slow leak that totally stumps the people I've brought it to twice 
to get it fixed.  Anyhow, so I bring it all across the street where we 
have a most convenient gas station with an air hose.  But the air hose 
is broken.  I toss things around and decide it'll be ok to drive a mile 
and a half down the road to the next gas station.  They have an air 
hose and it works.  So I pull out all the gear, jack up the car, pull 
all the bolts off, and when I try to pull the wheel off, it doesn't budge.

At this point, I'm really stuck. There's no way I'm going to get this wheel off
the car.  I called AAA and they came down and this HUGE MAN pops my wheel off
as if he was popping off the head of a dandelion.  Then we filled my slow-leak
spare and he informed me that a tire that looked like mine did (it had a bulge
on one side the size of Kansas and the other side had lots of cracks) was
definitely not fit to drive on.  Furthermore, he added I should get it replaced
for free because tires shouldn't degrade like that with such little usage.
Then the HUGE MAN hopped into his truck and drove off.

I know nothing about tires.  I think I could go to the dealership (I bought the
car in CA and I'm in MA now) nearby, but I really hate doing that mostly
because I just hate interacting with the people at the dealership.  I think
I'll just have to buy a new tire.  Blech.

And that's the end of the story where I found myself in a situation which I had
no hope of solving and I called AAA and they came to rescue me.
