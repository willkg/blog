   Subject: SourceForge.net Project Removal

   Greetings,

   ...

   The varium project on SourceForge.net, originally
   registered on 2000-01-14, meets the criteria we have set up for
   this purge.  If you fail to respond to this inquiry, your project
   will be removed in approximately 21 days.  A final warning will be
   sent in approximately 14 days if we have not yet heard from you.

   ...

I worked on Varium with Josh and Pat for a couple of years. The project
started out in C, then we talked about embedding Perl, then we switched
over to writing the whole thing in Python. That was in the end of 1998.
It's what got me coding in Python and also what got me working on
apsects of mud development--a hobby I continue to this day in several
forms which has helped significantly with my career and growth as a
developer.

Even though I stopped working on Varium in 2000 and started working on
`bluemud <http://bluemud.sourceforge.net/>`__ (another Python-based mud
server) and then left that project to work on
`stringbean </~willkg/stringbean/>`__ which hasn't really gotten very
far (for all kinds of really good reasons), it's sad to see these sorts
of beginnings finally pass into the quiet of the night.

I have access to the code-base if anyone is interested. As Josh pointed
out, there's very little documentation (i.e. almost none), the code-base
is messy, and it was written in the days of Python 1.5.2 when I (and
likely my cohorts as well) didn't really know what I was doing in Python
land.
