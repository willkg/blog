So I've been lurking on python-dev for almost a year now. I think it's
been a year--might be more. I forget. My friend just sent his first post
to python-dev. This is what he said:

   I'd like to suggest "outer v" for this.  The behavior could be to scan
   outward for the first definition of v.  If the only outer-scope variable
   is at module-level, then the behavior would be the same as "global v".
   Or if everyone is comfortable enough re-using the keyword "global", then
   I also like "global v in f".

It was pretty exciting. So I asked him how he felt. To this he
responded, "naked".
