Today was my last day at work for the summer at
`ByAllAccounts <http://www.byallaccounts.com/>`__. I spent the beginning
of the summer doing backend work and then hit a showstopper with the
project I was on. Then I spend the second half of the summer working on
extending our Custodial Integrator product to work with Advent APX (it
already worked with Axys). It was interesting, but I preferred the first
project I was working on because I was doing it nuts to bolts: research,
project plan, scheduling, work, testing, and quality control.

I told them I'm not going to work during the fall semester. I think with
the two classes I'm taking, I won't be able to give BAA enough time to
be effective/useful.
