I really loved reading this book. Between the sullen commentary of the
Arab revolution from the perspective of TE Lawrence to the wonderful
descriptions of the other characters involved it is at once a
fascinating piece that talks about the Middle East and the cultures that
exist there and also a journey by a single man putting forth all his
efforts for a cause he doesn't quite believe in.

Anyhow, it's phenomenal. Definitely worth reading.
