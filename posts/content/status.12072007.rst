Went out to lunch with Chris Blizzard, 
`John Resig <https://johnresig.com//>`__ and Dean (who I don't think has a blog).
That was pretty cool. We talked about a bunch of stuff and the
hamburgers at Christopher's in Porter Square (Cambridge, MA, USA) are
really good.

I continued working on adding enclosure viewing support to the subscribe
preview page in Firefox 3.0. I've almost got Yahoo MRSS support in.
Mental note: one wastes less time if one double-checks the tests to make
sure they're testing correctly. Oops.

I'm doing some minor mentoring for
`GHOP <https://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/>`__
mostly on PyBlosxom related tasks. I'm on both of the mailing lists for
GHOP-PSF and it's hard to keep in mind that the people working on these
tasks are students in high school and early undergrad. It's like an army
of really able, but not very experienced, bodies hungrily munching large
bites out of project todo items. PyBlosxom had 4 tasks in last week and
4 in this week. It's great because the help is fantastic and it's
forcing me to get around to work on organizing the project and
development for PyBlosxom 2.0.

If you're in high school or college and want to do some Python-related
work, definitely take a look at GHOP! If you're a Pythonista or
Pythoneer and have some spare cycles, definitely come help us mentor. If
you have a Python project and need help with screencasts, documentation,
testing and other small tasks, take a look at GHOP.
`Titus <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/>`__ has more on his blog.

PyBlosxom 2.0 is going to be a huge overhaul from PyBlosxom 1.4. I'm
getting lots of help from the people who hang out on ``#pyblosxom`` on
IRC, Ryan, Michael and various other people who pop on, ask questions
and help identify issues. Progress is excellent so far.

In PCF land, I have a blog focused on PCF work and Miro development.
It's at `<https://pculture.org/devblogs/wguaraldi>`__. I figured I'd keep it
separate. It runs on WordPress so that's giving me some WordPress
experience.

Whoever fixed NetworkManager for Ubuntu Gutsy should get a gold star. I
did an update on 12/4 and picked up a new set of packages and my
perpetual wireless networking problems all went away. Bless you!

Also, if you've got young children in your life, definitely take a look
at `Bee Careful Marvin <https://bluesock.org/~willkg/marvin/beecarefulmarvin.html>`__
It's geared towards children up to around 6 or so. You can get a
professionally printed version at Lulu, but you can also download a PDF
for free. It's released under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 3.0 license
and "the source" is all at that link. Print it out, copy it, give it to
your young friends, translate it, rewrite it with Star Wars dialogue,
etc.
