Today I was inducted into `Upsilon Pi
Epsilon <http://www.acm.org/upe/>`__ which is the "international honor
society for the computing and information disciplines". The induction
ceremony was a little weird, but I'm not sure I've been to an induction
ceremony that wasn't a little weird.

In undergrad I graduated with Honors from the university and Honors from
the Computer Science department, too. As far as I know, no one has ever
treated me differently. I think the only people who have expressed any
excitement one way or another are my parents and my fiance.

The real bummer is that I'm realizing that my grad school days are very
close to over and I'll be going back to work again. Hopefully I'll find
a job where my peers are as wildly excited about the technology as I am.

On a side note, there are some really great Wikibooks on computer
science topics.
