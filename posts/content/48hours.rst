My brother is organizing the 48 hour film thingy in Boston which
kicks off tonight!  I'm helping out to usher and perform in secret
kick-off rituals that I don't really understand but turn out to be
vital to the doings and goings-on of the 48 hour film thingy!

Anyhow, if you're in the Boston area, there are four showings of the
final films: two at the Brattle and two at the Somerville Theatre.

Lots of details and a half-naked picture of my brother 
`HERE <http://www.48hourfilm.com/boston.htm>`_.

One interesting thing about this one is that it's Spring Forward
this weekend--so they "extended" it an hour so that the groups
don't lose an hour if that makes any sense.  I think maybe one of
my jobs will be to hand out extra hours at the door--one per group
please!
