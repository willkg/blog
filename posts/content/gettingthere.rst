"Getting there..." That's my new motto. It's not "I finished it
yesterday", "I'll finish it up tonight" or even "I'm planning to do it
this weekend". Now it's "Getting there...". The last year has come with
some changes which have totally foobar'd my ability to predict when I'll
get to spend time on tasks and how long it'll take me to complete them.
It seems a bit demoralizing. I feel like I've got a huge backlog of
promises and the rate at which I finish tasks is much much less than the
rate at which I acquire new tasks.

Additionally, I think most of the tasks are much larger and more complex
now.

So my new approach is to not worry about completing things but rather
spend more time focusing on the incremental portions, document stuff,
and communicate with the rest of the folks involved. I'm thinking in
terms of questions like this:

* Can I spend some time on this to improve it?
* Can I throw time at that to make one person happy?
* Can I do some work on some other thing so that someone else can see
  what I'm doing and take it from there?
* Can I shed some light on the issue so that someone else can take it
  from there?

The important message being that we're moving in a positive direction.
We're in a game of inches and we're getting them one by one because
there are so many things in the backlog that I can't seem to finish
entire tasks in one sitting, so to speak. (Note to self--need to buy
that movie.) And there's a lot of "us" in "we"--it's not just me. It's
important to focus on documentation and communication so other people
are equipped to work on things that I can't get to any time soon.
