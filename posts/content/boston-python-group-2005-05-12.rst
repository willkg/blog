I finally attended the Boston Python Meetup monthly meeting.  Nate
did a presentation on ArchGenXML for building archetypes in Plone.
I have no Plone/ZOPE experience, though I do know what they are and
I've followed the projects for a bit.  The presentation was really
interesting and definitely broke the Plone/ZOPE ice for me.
