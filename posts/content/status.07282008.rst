I was at `OSCON <http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/home>`__
last week and met many people some of whom I've known for several years
(`Ted <http://www.sauria.com/blog/>`__,
`Steve <http://holdenweb.com/>`__, ...). I also met a bunch of people
who I've followed for many years and some people I've worked with when
doing the Firefox 3 work I did. It was really exciting to be there. I
didn't attend any keynotes or sessions, but the conversations I had were
well worth trekking all the way to Portland, OR and back. I also got to
spend a week with my sister who lives in Portland.

On the flight there and back, I worked on
`PyBlosxom <http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/>`__. I mostly concentrated
getting better acquainted with
`nose <http://www.somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/>`__ and
using nose and
`coverage <http://nedbatchelder.com/code/modules/coverage.html>`__ to
help guide my testing efforts. The results were phenomenal. I increased
the test count from 53 or so to 207, I increased coverage from some low
number to 57% and I discovered and fixed a bunch of bugs. Because I
switched to git over svn, I was able to commit locally and manage the
work I was doing. All very exciting.

`Miro <http://getmiro.com/>`__ is coming along very nicely. We took the
plunge to ditch the previous frontend for a new one that has fewer
layers of indirection. The results so far are encouraging--I think it
was absolutely the right thing to do. Incidentally, I blogged about
OSCON on my `Miro devblog <http://pculture.org/devblogs/wguaraldi/>`__.

In the last few months, I've thrown together several web-sites using
`werkzeug <http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/>`__,
`sqlalchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`__, and
`mako <http://www.makotemplates.org/>`__. I really like this stack since
it doesn't involve a lot of infrastructure and the number of files and
"things" involved is pretty small. I think this is going to be my
preferred stack for webapps going forward.

Just before OSCON, I signed up with `identi.ca <http://identi.ca/>`__.
It's my first micro-blogging account. Mostly I wanted to see what
micro-blogging was like and follow other OSCON attendees. OSCON had a
*lot* of back-channel conversations going on.

Just before signing up for an identi.ca account, I met
`Jack <http://jackdied.blogspot.com/>`__, who lives around the corner
from where I live. I wish I had made the effort to contact him years
ago.

I think that's about it. It's been an interesting few months.
