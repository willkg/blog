It's sobering to think that this time last year I was dealing with a car
that had no headlights because they were stolen. It's really funky to
have a car with no headlights. In the winter, it limits the time you
have to drive around to like 9 or 10 hours.

I've decided to participate in new year's resolutions this year. Some
folks think it's silly to do new year's resolutions since you should
follow through on your resolve throughout the year rather than use the
new year as an excuse to change your life. I'm in the "whatever works
works" boat. My resolutions this year are to floss more and to fix my
problems with organizing the things I say I'm going to do around my
schedule so that I actually get things done.

The first is easy--I should just floss more. The second is like the
hiccups--everyone has their own best super duper way of how to do it and
wants to tell you all about it in excrutiating detail.
