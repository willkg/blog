So this is my first post with my new blogging engine. I switched from a
partly hacked version of Steve Gutenberg's weblog thing to pyblosxom
which allows me to do blog entries with standard text files and a bunch
of other stuff.

Unfortunately, it's going to take a bit to get things converted over and
settled. We shall see....
