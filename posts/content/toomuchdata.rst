I have data issues. I have email going back to 1996 and I have documents
and other data formats for which I don't have the original program
anymore.

In regards to email, every now and then I get up enough energy to start
going through it and deleting email that's clearly not interesting. The
problem here is that I accumulate more email than I delete and I feel
like I spend a lot of energy and time organizing it.

In regards to the other data, I could keep moving it from format to
format but that also takes a lot of energy and time.

I don't keep a journal or a diary, so this data is really the only
records I have of past years. It's the only way I can get a glimpse of
how I've grown over time.

The question is how important is this data? Is it important to keep it
all, or is it good enough to just keep a few things that capture enough
of the essence of that period of time? Is it better to go through things
and create an "editorial" of that period of time with citations from the
original pieces and then destroy all the original data?

What uses does the data have? Maybe it's better to just jettison it all
and start afresh?
