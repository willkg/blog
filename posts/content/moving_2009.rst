I'm moving this week.  That's why I haven't been online much or doing
any work on Miro, PyBlosxom or other things I usually work on.

It gets better!  After I'm done moving, I'm heading up to my parents'
place while we have work done on the house.  I'll be there for a
couple of weeks.  I'll have Internet access and will be working, but
my cell phone doesn't get reception up there, so I'll be out of touch
in a different way.

Assuming all goes well, I'll be back home and everything will be
totally groovy in September.
