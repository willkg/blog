I just switched up to Firefox 0.9 and Thunderbird 0.7 and they're really
fantastic. I highly encourage switching to Firefox especially.

I keep reading articles about how people should dump Internet Explorer
(`article
1 <http://channels.lockergnome.com/news/archives/20040615_why_you_should_dump_internet_explorer.phtml>`__,
`article
2 <http://www.spywareinfo.com/articles/hijacked/prevent.php>`__,
`article 3 <http://blog.zinkweb.co.uk/?p=173>`__, `article
4 <http://www.it-analysis.com/article.php?articleid=11852>`__, ...) and
while they all talk about features, defects, bugs, standards support,
petty ui issues, and things of that nature, most of them miss the fact
that there are still a lot of sites out there that require IE and don't
work at all in any of the Gecko-based browsers. Amongst these sites are
banks, financial institutions, online stores, and corporate web-sites.
While I highly encourage people to make the jump to Firefox, I do
understand if you can't because some of the sites you need to access day
to day totally suck.
