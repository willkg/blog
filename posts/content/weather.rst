Today was one of those weird New England days where every weatherman was
right--didn't even matter what they predicted. On the drive to work it
was overcast. At around noon it was snowing with heavy gusts of wind
that made the snow go horizontal. At like 2, the snow had turned to
rain. At 5, it was sunny and while there were a few clouds dotting the
sky in wispy trails, there wasn't any evidence of rain or gusty snow.
Wacky.
