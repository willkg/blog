I bet I could come up with a usefulness score for a given web-page
that's based on the ratio of number of images to number of words. I
occasionally read articles about how people don't like to read large
blocks of text and that it should be skimmable and blah blah blah--but
in reality, I think if the ratio of images to text is high, then the
page is making up for in visual appeal what it lacks in raw information.

I guess the issue is that I prefer sites that are more like books and
encyclopedias than like marketing brochures.
