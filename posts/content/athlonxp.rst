Last night, S and I were walking to meet some friends at the crepe place
when I spotted a black mini-tower with a "free" sign taped to it. I
looked at it and it had been hand-built and had case fans with LEDs. I
figured that's kind of interesting. So I picked it up and brought it
home.

Needless to say we were late to meet the friends. But the next day
(today), I took a better look at the machine (i.e. I plugged it in and
turned it on). It's an Athlon XP 1800+ with 640 MB of RAM (or something
like that). I figure I'll slap one of the half-dozen hard drives I have
sitting around in it and use it as a spare build machine or something
along those lines. The things you find on the side of the road....
