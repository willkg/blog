I bought a couple of CDs at `cdbaby.com <http://www.cdbaby.com/>`__ and
this was in the confirmation email they sent back:

   Your CDs have been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with
   sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.
      
   A team of 50 employees inspected your CDs and polished them to make
   sure they were in the best possible condition before mailing.
      
   Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over
   the crowd as he put your CDs into the finest gold-lined box that
   money can buy.
   
   We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party
   marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of
   Portland waved 'Bon Voyage!' to your package, on its way to you, in
   our private CD Baby jet on this day, Wednesday, June 2nd.
   
   I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby.  We sure did.
   Your picture is on our wall as "Customer of the Year".  We're all
   exhausted but can't wait for you to come back to CDBABY.COM!!

That's so cool--I wish more places were like this.
