I finally beat it. I've sort of been working on it for a few years now
and I'd get stuck at various points. I never got stuck puzzle-wise. I
always got stuck trying to kill one guy without having my party
eviscerated.

Anyhow, I'm glad it's done and off my hard drive. Beyond that the story
was interesting, but the UI was kind of irritating (especially on my
laptop). I have Baldur's Gate II, but I think I'm going to wait to play
that for a month or so.
