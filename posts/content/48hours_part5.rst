I'm really glad this is the last group. I've ushered for every single
show thus far and my ass is really sore. When they sell out, I end up
either standing in the back or sitting on the floor--neither of which
are comfortable.

The hours are really long, too. Even though the Somerville Theatre is
right around the corner from my apartment, I'm getting to bed at 1:00am
after working at work for 9 hours and then at this thing for another 6.

There were some good movies in this batch. Now that I've seen all the
movies from all the groups, I'd have to say the first group was the best
overall, though there were movies in other groups that I liked.

The `ImprovAsylum <http://www.improvasylum.com/>`__ folks really like
musicals. They're really good at them, too. It's tempting to go see one
of their shows.
