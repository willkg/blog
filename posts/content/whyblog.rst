Originally I thought blogging would be an easy way to provide an up-to-date
status (and log) of the various projects I've got going on.  It becomes
very easy for an outsider to look at my blog and click a few links and
realize how often I work on a particular project and what other projects
are taking all my valuable time by distracting me.

After a few blog-like applications, I finally settled on pyblosxom
which didn't have everything I wanted, but it had the bonus of being
written in Python and that makes it super easy for me to fix and add
functionality.

Then I found myself working on the pyblosxom code-base and talking to
Wari at length about various pyblosxom things.

Now I blog for two reasons.  First to provide status on my projects
and second, to provide more data with which to test pyblosxom
functionality.

That's why I blog.  On top of that, I'm fascinated by the decentralized
collaborative forum that blogs provide.  It's not unlike editorials
in the newspaper.
