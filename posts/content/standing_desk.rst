Back in :doc:`October of 2010 <goodweek>`,
I created a standing desk. A friend of mine bought a Sears workbench and was using
that and while it was pretty cool looking, I wanted something I could more
easily nail things into. I've been meaning to write about this for a while.

I bought some two-by-fours and plywood and built most of it with that and some
scraps of wood I had lying around.

Since then, I built a stool to go with it and bought a shelf thing from Ikea
that goes to the right of it.

I think it took a day to build the standing desk, though I've tweaked it a
bit since I originally built it. It took a day to build my stool. Total
cost in parts for both pieces was definitely under $100.

Result is this:

This set up has lots of horizontal space, is set at the right height for
me, lets me sit when I'm weary and stand when I'm not, and has some storage
capacity so I'm not surrounded by stuff.

"Wait! What's up with all those computers?", you might ask. Well, the computer
breakdown is like this:

* one work laptop
* one laptop that I use for Skype/Vidyo for work
* one laptop I use for home stuff
* one desktop I use for home stuff and games
* one desktop that's the current `PCF <http://pculture.org/>`_ Windows build
  box for `Miro <http://getmiro.com/>`_
* one Macbook that's a backup `PCF <http://pculture.org/>`_ OSX build
  box for `Miro <http://getmiro.com/>`_

Then I have:

* one settop computer I'm not using at all
* one dead laptop

The dead computers should go away. The PCF build boxes will eventually be
re-homed, too.

And that's the state of my desk!
