I'm in the Boston area and it's snowing pretty hard out.  They're
saying all kinds of things like we should all just go back to bed
for a few days and sleep through it.

I'm proposing a less defeatist idea.  I vote we should all switch
to the New England diet!  Snow for breakfast, lunch and dinner!
If we all band together we can pull through this, lose a few pounds,
and clear our streets!  Because freedom shouldn't be allowed to
get snowed in!

But the New England Diet isn't going to stop there, no sir!
I'm going to write a book and start a company to produce
New England Diet meals and we'll ship them around the world and I'll
make a million dollars.
