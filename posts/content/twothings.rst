There were two things I did in the last 6 months that have significantly
changed my life for the better:

#. I stopped watching TV
#. I stopped reading Slashdot

In regards to TV, almost everyone I know watches too much TV. And it's
not as if they're watching good TV--they're watching things like
American Idol. What possible value does that show have other than pure
unintelligent entertainment? (Sociologists are excluded from this
question.) People tell me they feel like they're being bombarded by
advertising. If you get rid of your TV and find a browser that allows
you to disable pop-up ads--over half of the advertising in the world
melts away. Save yourselves!

I'm another anti-Slashdot person. Best of luck to the admin who try
their best in building a moderation system that allows me to read
comments without having to interact with the ignorant (yet exceptionally
vocal) masses. The only value I think Slashdot has at this point is as a
venue for political activism and education. Most of us have no clue
what's going on in the wiley world of legislation and it's nice to have
a couple of one-stop-shops to catch up on the list of things I can't do
any more.

Read more books! Get outside! Fight the powers that are crushing you
like bugs! Exercise! Brush your teeth! In these ways, you have the
habits for a healthier and happier life.
