Back in 1998, I bought a Dell Inspiron 7000 PII 266mhz monstrocity of a
laptop which weighs in at over 8 lbs. It's really heavy. It's seen its
fair share of action since then: it was toted back and forth between MA
and CT while I was doing consulting work; it was abused by an
x-girlfriend; it was shipped in a flimsy letter-sized envelope thing via
USPS; and then it's been through several moves since I move on average
once every 8 months. It's been through a lot.

The case is cracked, the things that latch the lid shut are broken, and
the power adapter has been fixed a few times (the last one by Brian who
had the right tools to fix it and thus it's been fine since [Thanks,
Brian!]). Even so, I powered it up last night, did an
``apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade`` and it's going fine. Slow,
but fine.

So this post is in homage to a laptop I bought back in 1998 that's stuck
with me through thin and thick and is still usable even after all these
years.

Dell Inspiron 7000 PII 266 mhz circa 1998 laptop, I salute you.
