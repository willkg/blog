I didn't follow Rocketboom daily, but I did watch it frequently. I
watched it today with Joanne. I liked Amanda better. First thing that
crossed my mind is that they picked up another pretty face to replace
Amanda. Why does it have to be a pretty face? Is Rocketboom just another
"pretty face vocalizing quip-ridden news"?
