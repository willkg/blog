It's the end of an era of my life, sad to say. I finally sold my car to
a dealership for less than I wanted, but at least I can put that issue
behind me and work on other things that need attention. I think I'm the
last of my crew to sell the car I bought during the dot com hay day.

Now I'm going to spend some time adding folder management features to
bluemail (which currently has none) and generally updating the codebase
to use fewer deprecated Python things.
