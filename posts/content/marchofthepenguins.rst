What a fun movie!  S and I saw it at the Loews
on Church St. in Harvard Square.  There were dozens of small
children there and occasionally through the movie we could
hear parents saying things to their children like, "See the
baby penguin?" and "See the baby penguin learn to walk?"
It was neat! Glad I saw it.
