I'm working for `PCF <http://pculture.org/>`_
(w00t!) and they're based in Worcestor, MA, so I've been telecommuting.  A friend of
mine helped start a co-working place a few months back and a couple of weeks ago
I joined as a part-time renter.  Long story short, 
`they wrote about us in the Boston Globe <http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2007/08/10/betahouse____a_haven_for_web_entrepreneurs/?page=1>`_.
The article is a little funny in that it makes it sound like some big fancy thing,
but really it's a couple of rooms with desks where a bunch of people work.  I
wasn't there when Carolyn came in and interviewed people--I was on my way to Oregon
for a family reunion.

At Betahouse, I've been sitting at a desk in what I've decided to dub the Python room.  
It's myself, `Nate Aune <http://www.nateaune.com/>`_ and another person whose
name escapes me who also works for `Jazkarta <http://www.jazkarta.com/>`_.

It's been exciting and they have a much faster internet connection than I do at
home.  Can't beat that.
