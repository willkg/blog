I've got one of those GRE study guide prep book things and they have
a wordlist of 3500 words that I should know.  The breakdown is something
like this:

* 50% are words I already know and use in my daily hooplah
* 10% are words I already know but I don't use them
* 10% are words I recognize, but couldn't tell you the definition
  if you asked

That leaves 30% of the words to learn.  Course, that's like 1000
words so I decided to put all the ones I didn't know in a wordlist
file and wrote a cgi script
to pull up a random word from a random wordlist (the 3500 words are
broken down into 50 or so wordlists) and give me the word and definition.
I figure I'll start using them in emails and other digital correspondence
and that way I'll cycle them into my vocabulary.

Feel free to join along in this little game of mine.  It's a game I like
to call, "I don't want to be studying--I want to be programming".
