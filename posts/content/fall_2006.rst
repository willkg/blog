I'm back in classes for my Fall 2006 semester of grad school at NEU CCIS.  I'm
taking two classes this semester: Semantics in Programming Languages with
Professor Wand and Advanced Software Development with Professor Lieberherr.  

I've had two sessions of the Semantics in Programming Languages class and it's
been really educational so far.  I'm in the process of learning LaTeX so I can
type up my notes and do my homework.  I picked up docbook a year ago or so to
do the PyBlosxom manual and some other work--I like LaTeX a lot more than I
liked docbook.

While searching the Internet for LaTeX tutorial/manual resources, I bumped into
`Getting to grips with LaTeX
<http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/index.html>`_.  It's been really
helpful--I've picked up almost enough to type up the first two days of notes.
The issue I have now is that I need to code some math symbols but I don't
really know what the name of the symbol is so it's difficult to find.
