I had an eye doctor appointment a few weeks ago and discovered my prescription
had changed.  It wasn't a huge big change like last time (I was in grad
school), but it was big enough to warrant new glasses.  Not to mention that my
current glasses were really scratched up and "well-used".

I have a very limited budget these days.  A couple of years ago I read
`Adventures in $40 eyeglasses
<http://www.43folders.com/2007/11/29/adventures-40-eyeglasses>`_.  I decided to
try buying a pair online this time around.

I bought my pair from `39dollarglasses.com <http://39dollarglasses.com/>`_.  I
got the Polermo frames ($39) and figured I might as well get the
anti-reflective coating ($24).  Add on shipping ($5 or something) and an extra
charge because my prescription is screwy ($20) and the whole thing was around
$90.  I had paid $310 for my previous pair.  I think $90 is a good step in the
right direction.  Next time, I'll probably wait for a special which would have
reduced the cost further.

I got them in the mail today.  They fit great, they're just as strong and feel
as good as the previous $310 glasses and I had completely forgotten I was
wearing new glasses a couple of hours after slipping them on.
