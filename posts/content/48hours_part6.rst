The previous posts were mostly about ushering and how much sleep I got.
I'd like to dedicate this post to Ed who didn't get any gametime in any
of my earlier posts. Ed's film was fantastic. It was at once eloquent
and moving. It was the only movie with aliens flying around in their
ships zapping people with their alien rays. It was the only movie with a
brain in a jar.

Ed was a thug and then a pirate. I think he should quit his current job
as a Web Developer and join the theatre. The world has enough Web
Developers but it yearns for men of Ed's talent.
