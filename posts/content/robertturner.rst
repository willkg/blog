S and I went to see the `Robert
Turner <http://www.robertturnerphoto.com/>`__ exhibit at `Harvard Museum
of Natural
History <http://www.hmnh.harvard.edu/exhibitions/index.html>`__ and it's
simply glorious. Definitely worth seeing if you're in the area--the
images are vivid and breath-taking. It'll be there until March 26, 2006.
