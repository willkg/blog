I bought a 2001 S4 brand new way back when I lived in Newport Beach, CA.
It's a fantastic car and when I moved back to Boston, I drove it cross
country--fun times!

So now I'm living in apartments in and around Boston and I've been
parking on the street. I kept tossing around downgrading to a car that
"blends in", but never got around to it. Last Sunday, some dork stole my
headlights. After talking with the insurance people and the Audi people
and discovering that it's not an uncommon thing to have one's Xenon
headlights stolen and that there's nothing I can do about it except
replace them, I decided that this was prime time to downgrade.

After talking with a sales guy for 15 minutes, I bought a nice little
used 2001 Jetta. It has the same exact body as my S4, but it "blends in"
a lot better and has halogen lights.

So the saga goes on. I can't even get my headlights fixed until the end
of January. Then I need to sell my S4. In the meantime, the stereo in my
Jetta kind of sucks so I may have to go hunting for a receiver that gets
radio stations and plays CDs and also has an 1/8" jack input so I can
plug in an MP3 player or other device.

It occurs to me as I write this that it's time to build an image plugin
for pyblosxom.

Anyhow, it's a bummer, but I'll live. Could have been worse. I'm lucky
that I was able to drive an S4 for a few years and that I can just go
get a "new" car when I have problems.

I'll miss that all red display and the punch on the highway but I won't
miss the hassle of replacing headlights. Foo on that.
