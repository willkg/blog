I'm heading off to Florida for a week for some vacation. When I get
back, I start the long process of re-learning all the things I knew in
college and figuring out the other things I need to do before grad
school.

Somewhere in there, I'll finish up some of the things I started in
PyBlosxom-land like the manual and fixing issues with the web-site.

Anyhow, if you're looking for me, I won't be around until July 6th.
