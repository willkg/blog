At least, I thought it was a bee. It might have been a yellow jacket. It
was flying by too fast for me to tell the difference. I should tell my
friend Jerome. He's allergic to bees. He has some kind of funky bee
radar--he knows where they are before they're within sight/hearing
range. He'll put his hand calmly on my arm and say, "There's a bee over
there." To which I respond, "Where?" And then he'll quietly say, "Beyond
that building." And I'll say, "What building? That monstrosity of a
building over there which people refer to as Gilette Stadium?--that
one?" "Yeah. If we're quiet, though, maybe it won't come over here."
Weirdo.
