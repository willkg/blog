I had my last class of Semantics in Programming Languages today. We
finished up with proving adequacy between the denotational semantics of
the Untyped Lambda Calculus (the P-omega semantics from Scott) with the
operational semantics. It was pretty wild stuff... Most of it a little
over my head but mostly because we zipped through it due to the
impending termination of class (class turns out not to be bottom--it
does in fact terminate).

I have a bit more to do on a project for my Advanced Software
Development class and I think I'm going to write up a case-study for
using DAJ to build a unit tester with test cases described by a DSL. DAJ
has all the pieces to make this very easy to design, build, maintain,
and modify.

I'm going to be doing a research project related to DAJ next semester
which I'm excited about. But... that's a month away at least. For now
I'm going to prioritize and cruise through my backlog of stuff I've been
sitting on. Like finishing up `the
work <http://bluesock.org/~willkg/blog/dev/pyblosxom/cleaningitup2.html>`__
I was doing on PyBlosxom over the summer.
