Yea, and lo Bluesock did gasp its last breath early Tuesday morn and
exhaled ne'er to be revived again. And lo, all my friends called me up
to tell me the news. I submitted two, nay three, tickets in the
tech-support ticket system. Minutes turned into hours.

Yea verily yea, Rob of the clan Atha did calleth up the ServerBeach
people and gave them angry Texas hell and they agreed to give us some
new hardware. Forsooth it turned out to be a defective disk or
motherboard or some such hardware issue (or so we think--hard to tell
when I'm in Boston and the server liveth in Texas).

Then on the second day, Bluesock rose again with a new mortal coil and
the old drive was mounted as a partition of the new. With great speed,
we re-configured and re-installed all the stuff we had configured and
installed on the original Bluesock.

Then when we were done, it was as if the tragedy had never occurred. The
users were happy once more [1]_.

.. [1] No users were actually asked--I just assumed.
