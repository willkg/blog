Sold the first guitar I ever bought today. I'm a little bummed about it
because of the sentimental value it had, but I have to get rid of things
to balance out getting new things. I'm trying to use mark and sweep
garbage collection on my stuff. The unfortunate part is that I'm a very
very slow CPU and it takes ages to do a single pass.
