A month ago, my girlfriend and I wrote a children's book about a bee who
gets stuck. It was pretty wild writing it--I had most of the process
down before I met her, but she definitely filled in the pieces I hadn't
figured my way through yet. It was really great--we were a great team.
Anyhow, so last week we finished moving the book over to PDF format,
printed a copy on the color printer downstairs, and gave it to my friend
to give to his daughter. Turns out she really liked it--which is really
great! And she wrote us a thank you note which was really really neat!

We enjoyed writing the book. We especially enjoy the fact that someone
enjoyed it.
