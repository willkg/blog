I volunteered at `ROFLCon <http://roflcon.org/>`__ yesterday and today.
The whole experience was really surreal but fantastic! I thoroughly
enjoyed the sessions I attended while "on duty" and the new friends I
made. I also came home with a sticker that says "Bacon is a vegetable".
That sums that up.
