Back in 2005, S and I wrote a children's book called Bee Careful,
Marvin. We did the entire thing by hand using free/open source software
(`Ubuntu <https://ubuntu.com/>`__, `Scribus <https://www.scribus.net/>`__,
`the Gimp <https://www.gimp.net/>`__, ...) and self-published it on
`Lulu <https://lulu.com/>`__.

After two years, I finally got around to updating the book. I updated
the license to a `Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 3.0
license <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/>`__, moved
the licensing text to the end, added a dedication page and updated the
colophon. I also put all the "source" in version control using
`Bazaar <https://bazaar.canonical.com/en/>`__ and built a
`Trac <https://trac.edgewall.org/>`__ instance to manage it and any other
books S and I write going foward.
You can see all this at `<https://bluesock.org/~willkg/marvin/beecarefulmarvin.html>`_.

The "source" is under a disjunctive set of licenses: `GNU General Public
License 3.0 or later <http://gplv3.fsf.org/>`__ and `Creative Commons
BY-NC-SA 3.0 <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/>`__.
People can choose which one fits their needs better.

The book is free--I encourage anyone to download it, purchase it, copy
it, give it to a friend, give it to a child, translate it, adjust the
layout, ... Light user testing has suggested it appeals to children
between 2 and 4 years of age.

It took forever to get around to figuring out how to manage the pieces,
but I'm pretty happy with what we've got set up. We're currently working
on the next book... hopefully we'll get it done by the end of the year.
