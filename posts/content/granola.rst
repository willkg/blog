My mother made great granola growing up. I think she got the recipe from
her mother. I know my sister makes it, too--it's good stuff.

I keep losing the recipe, though, so I figured I'd post it in my blog.
I'm not an aspiring chef, this isn't my hobby, and I don't watch the
Food Channel. So... this is probably a once-only recipe blogging
experience.

* 4 cups - rolled oats
* 1 1/2 cups - shredded unsweetened coconut [1]_
* 1 cup - wheat germ
* 1 cup - chopped nuts [2]_
* 1 cup - unsalted hulled sunflower seeds
* 1/2 cup - sesame seeds

* 1 cup - honey
* 1 cup - oil [3]_
* 1 teaspoon - vanilla extract

#. Pre-heat oven to 325 degrees. I don't follow this step... I heat the
   oven to 300 degrees. However, when I moved in my oven had no markings
   on the dial so I wrote them in with a Sharpie and it's not clear to
   me that my markings match up with reality. YMMV, but the key is not
   to burn your granola.
#. Mix all the dry ingredients in a big bowl. Sometimes I throw other
   stuff in, too--whatever I have lying around: flax seeds, wire-cut
   oats, extra sesame seeds, ...
#. Heat the honey in a small pot and mix in the oil and the vanilla. You
   just have to heat it enough such that the honey and oil mix.
#. Mix it all in the big bowl.
#. Spoon the granola onto a couple of baking pans that are 1 inch deep
   and like 9x13. If they're cookie sheets you're going to have a hell
   of a time stirring the granola--it'll get everywhere.
#. Spread the granola out so that it's not too thick anywhere.
#. Put the pans in the oven.
#. Every 5 to 10 minutes, take the pans out of the oven, stir the
   granola around and then put them back in. I swap which pan is on top
   and which is on bottom because my oven is hotten on the bottom than
   the top. Bake for no more than 30 minutes **total**.
#. Your granola is done when it's toasty brown. Your granola is overdone
   if it's dark brown and/or black.
#. I take it out, leave the pans on the stove to cool, and do some other
   stuff for 45 minutes. Then I take a spatula, break up the granola,
   and in the messiest possible way pour it into large yogurt
   containers.

Sometimes I throw in dried fruit like raisens in.

That's it!

.. [1] I find it difficult to find shredded **unsweetened** coconut in
   the grocery store, but I can usually find it at a gormet, organic, or
   health food store pretty easily. On the flip side, I don't get around to
   frequenting those kinds of stores often, so I just go with the shredded
   sweetened coconut. YMMV.

.. [2] Walnuts, pecans, and almonds are fine. I haven't tried other kinds
   of nuts, but I think most nuts will do.

.. [3] Vegetable oil is good. I think it'd probably be fine with sesame
   seed oil and some of the other oils. Olive oil is probably a bad choice
   since it's got a pretty distinct non-granola flavour.
