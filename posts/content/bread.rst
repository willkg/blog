Back in the day I used to buy my lunch from one of the surrounding sub
shops. That worked pretty well--it was \\$5.00 a day or so and it
guaranteed me a meal that sufficed to get me through the day.

Recently, I started to think about the economics involved:

::

        5      dollars a day
     *  5      days a week
     * 50      weeks a year (roughly factors in holidays and vacations)
    -----
    1,250

I figure that I can make my own sandwiches and cut that cost at least in
half. Thus I started to bring my own lunch most of the time.

The other day I bought Pepperidge Farms Sweet Buttermilk bread since it
looked pretty substantial. However, I discovered a sandwich made using
this bread is not unlike eating two spoonfuls of peanut butter and two
spoonfuls of jelly. A sandwich is not a sandwich when the bread part of
the sandwich is rather insubstantial.
