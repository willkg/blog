I was skimming `jkOnTheRun <http://jkontherun.blogs.com/jkontherun/>`__
[1]_ and he linked to an article called `The Tyranny of
Email <http://www.w-uh.com/articles/030308-tyranny_of_email.html>`__.
The article isn't very exciting, but there were a couple points that
caught my eye because they're crappy things that I keep doing but
shouldn't be. For example:

"First, never, ever, criticize someone in email. For reasons which I
have never fully grasped, any negative emotion is always amplified by
communication through email. Sometimes you intend to be critical -
someone has done something dumb, or said something silly, or emailed
something ridiculous. Resist the urge to reply. Sometimes you don't mean
to be critical - you're just making an observation, or engaging in
technical debate, or adding facts to a discussion. But as soon as you
sense that the recipient has taken your email as criticism, you must
immediately switch media - a face-to-face meeting is best, but a 'phone
call is also okay."

Also this one (less so):

"Second, don't get into prolonged technical debates in email."

Usually, the "technical debates" I get into over email are less
"technical" and more hyperbole. All hyperbole is bad! [2]_

.. [1] Every time I look at "jk", I think he's just kidding. It's
   confusing.
