1. You can bring your work home with you and sit on the deck and
   sip iced tea while working on stuff.
2. When the power goes off in the building and everyone around
   you does a cry of despair, you can keep doing stuff.
3. You can sit on the couch, you can sit on a lawn chair, you
   can sit in your bed, you can sit at a desk, you can sit on
   the bus, you can sit on the plane, you can sit on the train,
   you can sit on the floor, you can sit beside a door, you
   can sit outside, you can sit inside, you can sit in the mall,
   you can sit in the hall....
