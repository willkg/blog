Life: I had a really rough January, but I'm not going to get into the
details. The kitchen sink drain is working again, the pipes are
unfrozen, and our cell phones work [1]_.

School: My compilers class is going really well. My research project
needs a lot more attention.

PyBlosxom: I've been doing some PyBlosxom work again as Ryan gets ready
to do a contributed plugins pack release that has all the changes to the
comments plugin and all its friends. He's done some really great work
pulling things together.

I started hanging out on freenode on #pyblosxom after `Asheesh mentioned
it on the pyblosxom-users mailing
list <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.pyblosxom.user/1536>`__.
That's been pretty cool, but the channel has been pretty quiet most of
the time.

Wedding planning is ... coming along. I figure a wedding has 10,000
decisions to make of which maybe 5% of them are "big decisions" (venue,
church?, food, ...) and the rest don't really affect the big picture,
but they need to be made and it's way harder to make them and there are
thousands (silverwear, colors, flowers, flower arrangements, music,
favors, text for the invitations, the border on the invitations, the
pictures on the stamps for the invitation envelopes, color of the
envelopes...). It's been interesting. S has taken on most of the
planning lately since I've been sick and working on school work.

Things are moving along pretty quickly. In a few months I'll be
graduated, married, and (hopefully) employed!

.. [1] S and I get our cell phone service from `Working
   Assets <http://www.workingassetswireless.com/>`__ and they have the best
   customer support of any cell phone company I've been with. You call, you
   talk to someone immediately, they ask you questions trying to isolate
   the nuances of your problem, and then they work with you to fix the
   problem. No hold music, no tedious chit-chat, no scripts, no wasted
   time, ... And they call you back later to make sure the problem is
   resolved and that you're satisfied. It's just awesome.
