My brother is the producer this year for the Boston 48 hour film project
again.  So I showed up to help out on the kick-off on Friday night and
again for the drop-off on Sunday night.  All very exciting.

Last year there were some 48 teams.  This year there were 62 or 63 so
the place was packed.  As I was helping out, I recognized a lot of
people who did it last year--that's pretty cool.  I even remembered
some names here and there.

There are going to be 5 screenings this year.  We learned a lot about
ushering last year and I hope to employ ISO 9001 compliant policies (ha!), 
standards, and things of that nature to this year's ushering.  It's
going to be a busy couple of weeks!
