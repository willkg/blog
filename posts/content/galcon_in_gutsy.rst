I had to install the following on a fresh Gutsy install to get
`Galcon <http://www.imitationpickles.org/galcon/index.html>`__ working:

.. code-block:: shell

   sudo apt-get install python2.4 libsdl-ttf2.0-0 libsdl-mixer1.2 \
       libsdl-image1.2

Figured I'd mention it here. I don't have a Galcon Forums account and
don't really feel like creating one. If someone else has a Forums
account, post the above in case other Gutsy-users are having problems.
