It was a pretty wild year for me. I had a massive health crisis at the
beginning of the year, wrote an almost-working compiler for a functional
language using SML targetting SPIM, finished up grad school, got
married, landed a job at `Participatory Culture
Foundation <http://pculture.org/>`__, made a lot of new friends,
mentored a GSoC project, helped out with GHOP, started the big push for
PyBlosxom 2.0, released a new version of `Bee Careful,
Marvin <http://www.bluesock.org/~willkg/cgi-bin/booktrac.cgi/wiki/BeeCarefulMarvin>`__
under a CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license and submitted my first patch for Firefox
3.0.

I started the `Nomadic Telecommuting Herd <http://herd.jottit.com/>`__
which has regular meetings, but hasn't extended beyond Chris and I, yet.
I'll push this more at some point in the spring when it's more fun to go
outside.

I also joined a few projects that I haven't been able to get to yet like
the `Python docs project <http://www.python.org/dev/doc/>`__ and
`Geyser <http://www.progbox.co.uk/wordpress/?p=419>`__. I'm interested
in helping out both of them, but haven't found the time yet.

This year I want to tame the firehose, get some good work done,
participate more in other projects, possibly learn C++ and reach out to
other people in the area (Somerville, MA, USA) to get together and hack
more. I'd also like to get a new laptop, but the longer I wait, the
better the possibilities become.
