For the last month, I've been going through the house-buying process.
Today we found out we were approved for a mortgage and so now we're all
set.

Thus, it's official: PCF-Boston will be moving and will become
PCF-Near-Boston.

I plan to continue co-working [1]_.

There are a few ramifications. The first is that it'll be harder to take
me out for a cup of coffee if you're in the Boston area. The second is
that I probably won't be going into the FSF offices to help with
mailings anymore. The third is that there will likely be a period of a
few days in the middle of August when the build boxes will be down and
there won't be any nightlies.

One of the big boons is that my office will double in space which should
make it easier to get more things done since I'll have room for
additional equipment, monitors, and such. And I'll have more space to
produce podcasts and screencasts and such.

As a sidenote, the house-buying process is fricking nuts. And not in a
good way. Thank goodness for gscan2pdf, Gimp, Thunderbird, Postfix,
Debian, Ubuntu, and the dozen smaller bits that made my side of the
paper-pushing much much easier.

.. [1] Where "continue" is defined as "start coworking again which I
   haven't done in a long time because I just haven't had time to organize
   things".
