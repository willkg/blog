S and I wrote a children's book a year or so ago and only recently
finished making needed revisions and self-publishing it on
`Lulu.com <http://www.lulu.com/>`_.  We ordered a few
copies to make sure it looked good in print and they showed up today
and they're fantastic!

The book was created using Open Source tools 
`Gimp <http://www.gimp.org/>`_ and
`Scribus <http://www.scribus.org.uk/>`_.
The book is released under a `Creative Commons license <http://creativecommons.org/>`_
(`by-nc-sa 2.0 <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0>`_).
We decided not to collect royalties, so the price of the book is solely 
Lulu's publishing costs.

The book isn't perfect--there are some color issues I'm puzzled about.
It's our first book, though, and we're really excited--this is a wonderful
moment for both of us.
