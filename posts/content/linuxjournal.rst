A couple of issues ago, Don Marti passed editorialship of Linux Journal
to a new guy who immediately started tossing in his "rants" at the end
of the magazine. Additionally, the magazine got a face-over which seems
to me to be more marketing-oriented than content oriented but that might
fix itself over the next few issues.

Regardless, I find the "rants" to be obnoxious at best and downright
juvenile at worst. I find people who enjoy ranting and enjoy arguing
like it's a pleasurable hobby to be far worse for the general state of
things than those who research and mull in a quieter fashion.

For example, in the April 2006 issue, he rants with incredible vitriol
about people who are working towards building a clean-room open-source
implementation of Java. He goes on to say that he'd happily pay Sun if
they charged for Java because he uses Jedit and it's the best editor on
the planet.

This is such a bizarre misunderstanding of the state of things and he's
managed to do all of this in two paragraphs. But there's more! He moves
on to ranting about a bunch of other stuff and ends with this:

"Use what's best. What a concept. Linux developers seem to get it. It's
about time the open-source zealots got it too."

I find this stunningly naive and ignorant. Worse, it's one-sided and
emotionally-charged misleading drivel that other people are going to
read. It's definitely NOT what belongs in Linux Journal which up until
this new editor was filled with intelligent material, clever humor, and
useful information that I was eager to read every month.

Anyhow, bottom line is that my subscription is up next month and I'm not
going to renew.

I was tossing around not writing a blog entry about this, but then I
noticed `Jeff Waugh <http://perkypants.org/blog/>`__ write `his
thoughts <http://perkypants.org/blog/2006/03/15/requiem-for-linux-journal/>`__
which interestingly match mine.
