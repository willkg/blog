It's a shame that my laptop doesn't become stronger and healthier if I
give it a good workout on a regular basis. If this weren't true, then I
could run it through some regular weight-training and it'd work better
for me. Of course, if that were true of everyone's laptops, then you
could walk into a cafe and glance around at all the laptops and know
which people use their laptop primarily for word processing and email
and which people are doing fluid dynamics simulations, compiling,
Folding@Home and things like that.
