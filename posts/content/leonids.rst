It was cold, but they were pretty!  Though not as numerous
as last year when we went up to Middlebury, VT to watch them.
This year we watched them in my parents' back yard using the
house cleverly to block the moon.

I had one friend who told me to take pictures.  I don't have
that kind of picture taking equipment, though, so instead I offer
up a `link to other peoples' pictures <http://www.spaceweather.com/meteors/gallery_18nov02.html>`_.
