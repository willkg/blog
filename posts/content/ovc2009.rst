My jury duty trial finished up yesterday freeing me up for going to the
`Open Video Conference <http://openvideoconference.org/>`__. The
conference schedule looks pretty interesting. I'll try to hit
development related things as much as possible.

Sunday is going to be a hackfest day--looking forward to seeing other
Miro devs and devs from related projects and working on the future of
Open Video.

If you're at the conference, say hi!
