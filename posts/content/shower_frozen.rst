It was so freaking cold last night that the pipes for our shower froze
(again). Unlike the previous two times, this time they're totally frozen
as opposed to just mostly frozen where the hot water works but the cold
water doesn't.

The pipes go from the water tank all the way across the basement getting
smaller and smaller until they go up an outside wall in the corner of
the house to our shower. That corner of the house gets no sunlight and
it's exposed to the wind. The house has terrible, no-good, very-bad
insulation, too.

The last couple of times I was able to unfreeze the pipes by sitting in
the basement with a hair dryer in the hole that the bath tub drain pipe
comes down from. This time that didn't seem to work.

On top of that, our heating bill for last month was $400. Our landlord
says that's normal, but I looked through all the heating bills for all
the apartments I've rented over the lat 6 years and I've never used that
many therms before. This apartment isn't any bigger than previous
apartments--it's actually smaller! I think S and I are going to move
when our lease is up.

I think the moral of this story is that having alcohol wipes, an
extension cord, and a hair dryer on hand is really handy.
