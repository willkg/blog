I decided that having a Facebook account primarily for extending the
marketing/publicity for the work that I'm doing wasn't worth it. I
disagree with Facebook's "public by default" policy and the way they
roll out changes to their Terms of Service and privacy settings. I think
their recent change to make the ui for privacy settings easier to use
(and not require a phd) is a good one, but not good enough for me to
feel comfortable giving my data (or that of my friends and family) to
them.

I'm also in the process of signing the copyright assignment statement to
join the GNU Social project to build a federated system that gives
people full control over their data. I'll be looking into building these
features into PyBlosxom, as well.
