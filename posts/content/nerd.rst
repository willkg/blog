I just finished the midterm for my Principles of Programming Languages
class with Professor Mitch Wand and it was an absolutely exciting
experience. So exciting that when I got home I wrote an email to
Professor Wand telling him that it was the most exciting exam I've had
at Northeastern. It was filled with all these exciting mind-bending
puzzles complete with subtle nuances and all kinds of exciting stuff!

So then I told S that I just wrote my professor to tell him that the
exam was really awesome. Then it occurred to me that I'm a nerd--the
evidence is clear on that note. Then I said, "Gosh--I should just follow
it up with an entry on my blog!" At that point, S burst out laughing and
said, "You know you're a nerd when you come home from a midterm, write
to the professor telling him it was really great, and then write a blog
entry about the whole thing complete with introspection of the entire
event." Well, she didn't say that whole thing, but she was definitely
thinking it.
