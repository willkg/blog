The weekend whizzed by....

* hosted a christmas party--drank lots of eggnog and listened to
  stories from
  `Mike <http://www.livejournal.com/users/orangejulius/>`__ and `Chris
  D <http://www.bluesock.org/~chrisd/>`__
* cooked eggs a la H
* played D&D (my character is no longer possessed by a demon! w00t!)
* worked on
  `pyblosxom.sourceforge.net <http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/>`__
* watched the movie Singles
* christmas cards
* worked some more on
  `pyblosxom.sourceforge.net <http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/>`__
* did the first pass at cleaning "my office"
* booked a trip in February to Florida

Then I came into the office and skimmed Planet Debian while our Internet
connection was going up and coming down faster than a 5 year old on a
pogo stick and bumped into
`this <http://www.livejournal.com/users/amayita/26923.html>`__. It was a
good weekend.
