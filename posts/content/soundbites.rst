S and I finally got around to going to Sound Bites--a restaurant in
Ball Square about a half mile from Davis Square in Somerville, MA.
It's really kind of silly--I've been living in the area since 2002
and I knew the place was there and I knew about all the fancy things
people said about it.  I even knew a bunch of people who've been there
and can't think of anything else to say other than, "dude--the food is
amazing."

So this morning, S and I decided to start our day with brunch at
Sound Bites after having mildly terrible Thursdays and it was wonderful!
