I'm playing music in Winamp and the volume is too loud. It's at this
point that I realize I'm going to have to find the fifty places that
control volume on my machine. They are:

* Winamp - has a volume slide thingy
* Windows - has a volume slide thingy for "Wave"
* Windows - has a volume slide thingy for "Main"
* my laptop - has a master volume which is adjusted by the Fn and VolUp
  and VolDn keys
* my headphones - has a volume thingy between the headphone jack and
  the headphones

There seem to be a lot of things in computing and life that are like
this.
