The hard drive on my laptop was doing some weird things on occasion and
I decided to get a new one and an external case to stick the old one in.
Figured while I was going to be replacing my hard drive I might as well
install Feisty Herd 5 and use that.

Installation had no problems.  I was up and running with all the
updates in 3 or 4 hours (I have a slow Internet connection and there
were a lot of updates).  I fiddled with things to get Beryl working
mostly because I want an Expose kind of thing, but ...  it was really
sluggish (I've got a Gateway 450ROG with an ATI Radeon Mobility 7500)
so I removed it.

Everything looks good so far.  Figured I'd mention it in case anyone
else was thinking about Feisty Fawn.

**Updates:**

3/19/2007: I traded emails with Patrick and he helped me configure
aiglx correclty.  I've got Beryl 0.2 working very smoothly--some of the 
features it has are already making a huge difference in usability.  w00t!
Also, there's an article on `Ars Technica <http://arstechnica.com/>`_
that walks through Beryl features called
`Bring on the bling with Beryl <http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/beryl-bling.ars>`_.
That helped, too.
