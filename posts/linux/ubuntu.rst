Wow--I just installed Ubuntu on my "new" desktop (a PIII 450mhz)
and it's very very nice.  Installation was refreshingly easy--I
didn't have to tinker with anything.  Then I unison'd my user
directory over from my laptop and ...  tada!  I'm productive.

I highly recommend it to myself.  If you're like me, then you'll
probably like it as well.

Having said that, and as most of these reviews will point out,
this is a pre-release.  If you check the Ubuntu forums, it's pretty clear
they put this out to get feedback for the final release.
