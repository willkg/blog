`This <http://people.debian.org/~debacle/refcard/>`_
is a fantastic reference card for those of us who use Debian, but not
so much that we've got all the commands ingrained in our heads until
the end of time.  Pretty fantastic piece of work.  I wish I had one
for vim.

**Update**

03/14/2005 - I fixed the url to the reference card.
