I've been running Edgy Eft for a week or so now.  In that time, I have 
successfully performed the following feats that surprised me:

* docked and undocked my laptop without shutting it down and restarting
  (something that Windows XP would bluescreen on); the battery applet
  pops up, the screen dims, the laptop <i>knows</i> when it has been
  docked and undocked
* undocked my laptop, plugged in an HP 1510 PSC printer (USB connection),
  added a new printer, and printed out my estimated tax forms (which I need
  to fill out pronto)
* switched between docked and ethernet to undocked and wireless (for some
  reason I consistently had problems with my wireless connection)

Minor point: I've only had Windows XP and Ubuntu Edgy Eft Knot 2 (with
lots of updates so far) on my laptop, so I can only compare between them.

The reason I bring this up is that I'm really excited because this is
really fantastic.  The total amount of time I've spent installing, 
fixing configuration files, reading through forums and researching 
problems, etc. is at most an hour.  I spent some time trying to figure 
out a minor problem I had with installation, but that's it; everything
has worked in a way that has been hassle-free.

I'd like to thank the Debian folks, the Ubuntu folks, and all the other
thousands of folks who've worked to make this a reality.
