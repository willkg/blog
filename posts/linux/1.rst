bluesock.org is (as of the time of this writing) a leased server
hosted at rackspace.com and we've been there for a few years.  They've
been great and we've never had problems with them.  Recently they informed
us we needed to upgrade to RedHat 9.0 and it either involved a per-month
rate increase or some finagling with the hardware and downtime.  I
decided this was as good a time as any to switch over to a different
hosting service with Debian.

This will make the third Linux flavor that I'll have extensive 
administration experience with.  The first two being RedHat (I've
run many of the versions since 5.2) and Gentoo (which I've been
running for a couple of years now).  I ran Mandrake for a bit, but
never really did anything with it.  Same with Slackware.  I toyed
with Debian a couple of times, but never got past the installation.

It's all very exciting.  Hopefully, everything will turn out just right.
