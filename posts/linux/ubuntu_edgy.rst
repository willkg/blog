I installed Ubuntu Edgy Eft on my Gateway 450something-or-other laptop
a couple of days ago.  I had one problem with installation where X
doesn't come up, but pressing Alt+F3 a bunch of times does something
and then everything works nicely.  I haven't had any problems since then.

Figured I'd mention it in case anyone else was thinking about Edgy Eft.
