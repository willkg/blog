Every week or so, I have a 30 minute block of time where I decide
I'm going to go tackle installing Debian on my Dell Inspiron 7000.
It's good for me to keep trying this because it's incredibly humbling.

The machine has a CD-ROM drive, but it doesn't handle CD-RW discs (or
at least it doesn't handle the ones I have).  So every attempt I make, 
I create a coaster.

Going to try one more time.  This time with a Knoppix cd.  The biggest
problem I'm having is getting the machine on the network.  Once I
get that done, then I'll be ok.  But I can't seem to get the machine
on the network with either my 3Com 10baseT pcmcia card or my 
SMC wireless pcmcia card.

One more time....
