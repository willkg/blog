The `Ubuntu Massachusetts LoCo Team <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MassachusettsTeam>`_ is
hosting an `Ubuntu Install Fest <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MassachusettsTeam/Events/InstallFests/2007-10-13>`_
on 10-13-2007 from 9:00am to 5:00pm in Cambridge, MA.

  "The festival is an opportunity for the Ubuntu team to show normal computer 
  users how easy using the Linux software has become. Volunteers will be on 
  hand to answer questions, present demonstrations and help users install the 
  free, open source Linux operating system. Ubuntu CDs, case badges, drinks and 
  snacks will be available."

The case badges are pretty nice.  I put one on my laptop a week ago and already
people have asked about it.

I think I'm going to be bringing my laptop and depending on what's going on, 
I will demo `Miro <http://getmiro.com>`_.

See `the wiki page <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MassachusettsTeam/Events/InstallFests/2007-10-13>`_
for more details (date, time, location, press release, ...).
