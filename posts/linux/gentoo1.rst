I spent the greater portion of the last two weeks installing
`Gentoo <http://www.gentoo.org/>`_ on my laptop.  I wanted
to get more in depth with Linux internals and administration
and additionally my laptop is somewhat underpowered and it
benefitted greatly from doing a source install rather than a 
binary install.  Things are much snappier under Gentoo than they
were under Mandrake--which is the Linux distribution I used prior.

I have ALSA, APM, Gnome (with Metacity), Xmms, GDM, vim, pure-ftpd,
X, gcc 3.2, pcmcia with a wireless ethernet card (SMC 2632) and 
a series of other things all installed and working happily with 
everything else.  

The Gentoo forums are great for help as is the mailing list.  I found
I was able to fix all my problems without too much looking around.

At some point I may post the various configurations involved in getting
ALSA and the wireless pcmcia stuff working--that was probably the
hardest part and required the most tinkering.  The rest was cake.
