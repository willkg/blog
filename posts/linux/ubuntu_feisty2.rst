I don't use the right alt key much and at some point in time it just
stopped working.  I thought the key itself was dead, though that was
puzzling.  Turns out Ubuntu Feisty (and possibly earlier versions--I
have no idea) maps the right alt key to a third-level character
input key for extended characters.

I bumped into the System -> Preferences -> Keyboard panel and also discovered I
can very easily switch my caps lock key to a control key.  Ahhh...  happy emacs
pinky....
