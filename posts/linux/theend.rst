I was running Gentoo on my Dell Inspiron 7000 laptop but today I've gone and
slicked it.  I'm going to switch my laptop over to use Debian.  Gentoo is
pretty neat, but it takes me days to compile GNOME and I'm hitting the point
where the novelty is wearing off and I want to actually *use* my laptop.

Anyhow, I recommend it for folks with more powerful machines.  I enjoyed
running it and learned a lot in the process.
