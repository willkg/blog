I went to the Gentoo introduction thing at MIT last night.  I mostly
went because my friend Brian is toying with Gentoo now and I thought
it would help him along to get something more than the documentation
and it would give me a good idea of how much Gentoo I know.  Turns
out I know a fair bit.  I learned one or two minor things, but
generally already knew the material.

One thing of note was that Rajiv said that if you trusted the
developers' decisions in regards to building the stage 3 package, 
you might as well start there and skip the first two stages of
installation.  I disagree.  I don't think most people appreciate
the sheer magnitude of effort that has gone into GNU, the Linux 
kernel, the drivers, Mozilla, Python, X, OpenOffice or other
components.

Ooops...  Got sidetracked.  Anyhow, the introduction was interesting.
