I'm totally fascinated by game economies as they generally approximate
real economies but usually have "faked" aspects because game economies
usually lack feedback loops that real world economies have. Blah blah
blah I am not an economist so I'm kind of fudging my English here blah
blah blah. Regardless, I still find it really fascinating. I also find
game weather systems really fascinating.

Anyhow, there's an entry on issues in the Star Wars Galaxies economic
system that led them to discover cheating. It's detailed
`here <http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/content.jsp?page=Astromech%20Stats%20Economy>`__.
There's some more information on it
