I had a craptastic conversation with one of the admin on Dark Rifts a
couple of days ago the end result being that I decided to cut my losses
and leave. They're not going in directions I'm interested in and I don't
really have time for it anyhow.

Between all the mud projects I've worked on, I've probably written a
couple hundred thousand lines of code in Java, Python, C and ending with
LPC over the course of the last 7 or 8 years.

I'm still kind of bummed about it and I think that's the end of mud
projects for me unless I get involved in `Twisted
Reality <http://twistedmatrix.com/products/reality>`__ or
`Phantasmal/DGD <http://phantasmal.sourceforge.net/>`__. Twisted Reality
is really interesting, though it's really different from other mud
systems I've worked on.
