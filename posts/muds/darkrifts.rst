In my copious free time, I do some work on a mud named DarkRifts. The
mud itself runs on `MudOS <http://www.mudos.org/>`__ on top of a mudlib
based on a mudlib based on TMI-2. I've worked on a few other mud
projects, but decided I didn't want to run my own mud since I don't have
enough time for that and it'd be better to help out with someone else's
mud.

The mud is still pretty infantile in terms of maturity of the codebase
and player base. We have seven guilds that are in-game (two of which are
"starter" guilds) in two realms with twenty-nine different areas and
several cities. We've got a few alpha-testers who come irregularly.

There's a lot of polish work to be done--but we're not at that stage
yet, though we are progressing. One difficulty is that our alpha-testers
are pretty irregular in their testing. So the mud is pretty quiet most
of the time (I think we average 2 players online). The other difficulty
is that we could use a few more coders to help even out the rough edges
on that side of the equation.

Anyhow, if you have any interest in seeing what we've got going on,
helping out, or otherwise chiming in, check out the `DarkRifts
website <http://www.darkrifts.org>`__ and/or add a comment below. If you
log in, my name is "Flake". I idle there during the day and do some work
on nights and weekends (I'm in Boston, MA which is Eastern Standard
Time). Please drop in and say hi!
