I like passively watching memes but not participating because I'm not
into getting-to-know you blog posts. But...
`Chris <http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/?p=770>`__ has a "youtube four
meme" that's amusing.

I only have two that come up. I don't visit Youtube often.

* `Powerthirst <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRuNxHqwazs>`__

#. Open your fancy Firefox 3 browser.
#. Click on the awesomebar and type in ‘youtube’.
#. Post the first four videos that come up.
