One of the things I keep reading in comments of various Miro-related
reviews is something along the lines of "there's no good content". I
think that's utter bunk. There's a lot of good content listed in the
Miro Guide. The channel starter packs that we added to the first page
when you start up Miro 1.0 make this painfully clear. This doesn't even
include all the content that's not even listed in the Miro Guide.

I don't have cable tv anymore because it doesn't make sense to waste my
money on it.

I also don't watch a ton of shows with Miro. However, here's the list of
shows I do watch (some of them while testing):

* `Ask a Ninja <https://www.miroguide.com/channels/625>`__ (`Add to
  Miro <http://subscribe.getmiro.com/?url1=http%3A//feeds.feedburner.com/AskANinja>`__)
  - Occasionally there's an annoying show, but mostly I think it's
  pretty funny. I saw the Recipe For Disaster episode just before a
  family reunion--couldn't have had better timing. I first discovered
  Ask a Ninja when one of the NPR programs I listen to periodically (I
  forget which one it was) had their movie critic off for the week and
  they played the audio from the Ask a Ninja episode reviewing Pirates
  of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl. (Disclaimer: I have
  ninjas on my business card.)
* `Make Zing :: Blog MAKE
  Podcast <https://www.miroguide.com/channels/79>`__ (`Add to
  Miro <http://subscribe.getmiro.com/?url1=http%3A//makezine.com/blog/archive/make_podcast/index.xml>`__)
  - I love this channel. The projects are really interesting and it
  covers a very wide variety of topics. Dean, my brother and I met Bre
  at `PodCamp Boston 2 <http://podcamp.pbwiki.com/PodCampBoston2>`__
  and my brother secretly thinks that the t-shirt cannon project was
  influenced by his story of kids launching potatoes at a river from a
  cannon in their chimney (long story--very odd).
* `Galacticast <https://www.miroguide.com/channels/1001>`__ (`Add to
  Miro <http://subscribe.getmiro.com/?url1=http%3A//feeds.feedburner.com/galacticast>`__)
  - I met Casey at `PodCamp Boston
  2 <http://podcamp.pbwiki.com/PodCampBoston2>`__ and after hearing
  about Galacticast decided to look it up. It's a great show!
* `What you ought to know <https://www.miroguide.com/channels/3726>`__
  (`Add to
  Miro <http://subscribe.getmiro.com/?url1=http%3A//feeds.feedburner.com/WhatYouOughtToKnow>`__)
  - The shows are almost all under 3 minutes long and they cover a
  variety of topics. It's thoroughly educational in tiny bite-sized
  chunks.
* `Wired Science \| PBS <https://www.miroguide.com/channels/3903>`__
  (`Add to
  Miro <http://subscribe.getmiro.com/?url1=http%3A//feeds.pbs.org/pbs/kcet/wiredscience-video>`__)
  - This is a great general science channel.
* `WebbAlert <https://www.miroguide.com/channels/3066>`__ (`Add to
  Miro <http://subscribe.getmiro.com/?url1=http%3A//feeds.feedburner.com/webbalert%3Fformat%3Dxml>`__)
  - Morgan Webb and her crew do a really good job of distilling "tech
  news" down to a 5 to 6 minute program Monday through Thursday. I find
  watching this saves me the trouble of flipping through the series of
  blogs I used to flip through.
* `Google Tech Talks <https://www.miroguide.com/channels/2701>`__ (`Add
  to
  Miro <http://subscribe.getmiro.com/?url1=http%3A//video.google.com/videofeed%3Ftype%3Dsearch%26q%3Dtype%253Agoogle%2BengEDU%26so%3D1%26num%3D30%26output%3Drss>`__)
  - Some of the Google Tech Talks aren't wildly interesting to me, but
  I've learned a lot from the ones I have watched. This channel is
  based on a Google Video search and so you're going to want to set the
  Auto-download to OFF. Otherwise it's likely you'll pick up old videos
  you've already seen.
* `Onion News Network <https://www.miroguide.com/channels/1838>`__
  (`Add to
  Miro <http://subscribe.getmiro.com/?url1=http%3A//feeds.theonion.com/OnionNewsNetwork>`__)
  - I usually test with ONN because it's fantastic. The "Ninja parade
  slips through town unnoticed again" episode got a lot of play time on
  my systems--it makes me smile every time. (Disclaimer: I have ninjas
  on my business card.)

I think there's a lot of other great content out there both to watch and
to participate in.

So to people who shrug Miro and Internet video off because "there's no
good content" I say, "Buddy--this is 2007 and you're missing the boat".

What shows do you like and why? Toss your thoughts in the comments.

**Updates:**

11/16/2007: Fixed a grammar issue and somehow I managed to
misspell Galacticast.
