Miro 3.5.1 status
(`roadmap <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/roadmap.cgi?product=Miro&target=3.5.1>`__)

* there are a handful of fixes that suggest we should do a 3.5.1 soon
* 3.5.1 will include updates to the conversions
* Ben elected to coordinate and shepherd 3.5.1

Miro 4.0 status
(`roadmap <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/roadmap.cgi?product=Miro&target=4.0>`__)

* working on audio file metadata retrieval, storage, and ui
* working on device syncing
* working on performance enhancements for startup and displaying tabs
* working on extension framework
* switching testing from eggplant to sikuli

Will:

* worked on documenting infrastructure, processes, and other things
  he's involved in
* did a lot of peer-review on incoming changes
* fixed some minor things--added app.debugmode
* could disappear any day now for paternity leave--ping me if there are
  things you need me to do now

Ben:

* landed a bunch of performance changes (and fixes)
* working on figuring out all the things that make the iteminfocache
  invalid
* sent email about setup_restored(...); working on that

Kaz:

* worked out a different way of doing metadata
* working on ui bits for metadata

Geoffrey:

* worked on ui glitches and other bug fixing

Janet:

* working on converting eggplant tests to sikuli tests
* there are a few bugs that we should make p1 for 3.5.1
* we should start thinking about doing a 3.5.1

Asheesh:

* working on maturing Miro Community as a public FLOSS project

Order of business:

* we updated the appcast file which notifies users that there's a new
  version of Miro out there; 3.5 is doing pretty well
* talked about setup_restored(...); Ben has some steps for working on
  this going forward
* Ben's going to shepherd the Miro 3.5.1 release which involves making
  sure all bugs for 3.5.1 are targeted appropriately and all fixes are
  cherrypicked into the Miro-3.5 branch--he's going to coordinate the
  3.5.1 release going forward
* for Miro 4.0 on Windows, we're going to switch from VLC to gstreamer
  and also from xulrunner to webkit; we talked about who's going to do
  this work and when and we're all pretty busy right now, so it'll
  likely happen in December or thereabouts
* We decided to push off a Python 2.6 to 2.7 upgrade until a future
  release unless we hit a really compelling reason to do otherwise
* Miro is developed by a community of people including you! If you
  can't contribute your time and work, please consider contributing
  funding by `donating <https://www.miroguide.com/donate>`__. Your
  money goes directly to ongoing development of Miro and related
  projects. See http://pculture.org/about/ for more details on these
  projects.
* Did you know there's a Miro User Manual? If you haven't looked at it
  yet, it's worth taking a look at. You can find it at
  http://getmiro.com/userguide/.

**Bugzilla stats for Miro:**

* 38 bugs/feature-requests created
* 7 bugs marked WORKSFORME
* 7 bugs marked INVALID
* 9 bugs marked DUPLICATE
* 19 bugs marked FIXED
* 12 bugs marked INCOMPLETE

As a side note, this is the third week we've been trending downwards in
total open bug count for Miro. We're working on triaging and cleaning up
bug reports. That's been a lot easier with additional staff--your
donations go directly towards these efforts!
