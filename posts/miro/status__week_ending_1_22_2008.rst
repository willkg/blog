Things I did this week:

* Visited the Worcestor office on Thursday.
* Cut a 1.1.1 rc1 release.
* Cut a 1.1.1 final release.
* Built Gutsy, Feisty and Dapper packages for 1.1.1... then spent half
  a day dealing with repository issues resulting from Gutsy i386
  miro-data package being slightly different in some way than the Gutsy
  AMD64 miro-data package. I haven't figured out the problem here. I'll
  try to do it this week. I suspect foul play. Probably my fault. If
  you're having problems with Gutsy, Feisty or Dapper packaging for
  Miro from the PCF repository, let me know.
* Pulled an all-nighter Friday night working on and finishing up
  patches for
  `400061 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=400061>`__ and
  `400064 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=303645>`__.
  Then spent several days talking with Mozilla folks, fixing the
  patches based on reviews and generally trying to get as much done as
  possible to increase the chances of these patches making it into
  Firefox 3.

Things I plan to do this week:

* Continue pushing the patches for
  `303645 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=303645>`__,
  `400061 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=400061>`__ and
  `400064 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=400064>`__
  until they're landed.
* Figure out what the problem with building the miro-data package is.
* Figure out what to do about a new laptop. I'm currently looking at
  the Dell 1420N and System76 laptops. Any thoughts on Ubuntu-based
  laptops would be hugely useful.
* Try to avoid getting involved in anyone else's work until the patches
  for Firefox are out of my hands.
* Spending some time with my wife before she forgets who I am.
