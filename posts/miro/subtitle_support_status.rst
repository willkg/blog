We've been working on subtitle support for Miro in the subtitle branch.
Yesterday, Ben merged the changes into the master branch. As of this
morning, nightly builds have subtitle support. Yay!

There are still a few things to implement and the code hasn't had much
of a chance to settle. Also, there are still some things I think should
get refactored and it's likely we'll be tweaking the interface going
forward as we use it more.

Still, it's good to have landed the bulk of this feature. It's probably
not wildly useful yet, but it gives us some ground work towards building
better subtitle distribution/creation infrastructure going forward.
