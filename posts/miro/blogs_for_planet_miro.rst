If you know of other blogs that would be appropriate for Planet Miro,
send an email to will dot guaraldi at pculture dot org and let me know.

The loose goal for the planet is to aggregate Miro-related blogs:
developer status, testing, news, ... If at some point the planet gets
too big, we can split it up into focused planets.

I'd like to see some blogs from the rest of the community: users,
TeamMiro, etc.
