I did some bug triage today and then went through and fixed some old bug
data (apologies to everyone for the bug spam). A couple of interesting
things came out of that.

First off, it's interesting to note that 2.0 so far has 163 bugs marked
as FIXED. That's more than any version of Miro since 0.9.5. Hard to know
what happened before that because we have inadequate bug data. Go team!

Second, there are a total of 877 open bugs right now. 323 of those are
targeted as Wishlist items. We've been around the 850 mark since
September with a big bump between December and February in the 1000
range. I think that means generally speaking that we're keeping up with
bugs which is good.

Third, it's pretty clear that the widget overhaul will clear out a lot
of older bugs. Partially because we're ditching the HTML interface and
the issues that caused, but also because we're re-implementing a lot of
stuff and in doing that, fixing issues in the process.

Miro 2.0 is going to rock your socks!
