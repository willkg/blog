Just as a word of warning, if all goes well, Ben will be merging into
trunk what he and others have been working on over the last few months
in the next day or so. When that happens, trunk will become **very
broken** and will remain that way for possibly a week as folks work on
stabilizing the new user interface code and reimplementing a bunch of
features... silly things like being able to play videos.

If you're tracking trunk or using nightlies, you should seriously
consider waiting a week to update.

You might ask, "Gah! What a bunch of idiots! Why are they doing this?!"
The answer is that the widget overhaul is very badly needed and it'll
fix one of several big performance issues that Miro currently has. It's
a big change and it'll cause a big mess for a short while, but it's
going to make a big big big difference.

In order to do this quickly, we'll be focusing pretty hard on getting
trunk working again for a while. My apologies if any of us seem like
we're dropping off the face of the earth or ignoring questions,
concerns, ...
