The GNOME folks are meeting in Boston for the `Boston GNOME Summit
2007 <http://live.gnome.org/Boston2007>`__. I met up with
`Asheesh <http://www.asheesh.org/>`__ (who turned out to be a
`PyBlosxom <http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/>`__ user I've known for a
while) last night and talked with Stefan from Nokia about Miro,
gstreamer, and the possibilities of porting Miro to the Nokia Internet
tablets.

Tonight, Dean, Chris and I met up with Asheesh (Creative Commons) and SJ
(OLPC) and talked about Miro in relation to Creative Commons and OLPC.
After that, we headed over to Flat Top Johnny's and talked with more of
the people who were here for the GNOME Summit.

Most of the people I talked to knew about Miro--that was neat. There's a
lot of interest in Miro and its future directions. In many ways it's
really exciting, but in some ways it's really daunting. How do you
choose between the myriad of interesting future directions? We've got a
limited number of people working on Miro, so we can't choose them
all--at least, not for the next version after 1.0. It's a good spot to
be in, but at the same time, a little depressing since it would be a lot
of fun to do everything. :)
