I keep seeing people say things like, "I'm not a programmer, so I can't
help."

I think this is a common misconception about Free Software. Free
Software empowers you. Let me say that again...

**Free Software EMPOWERS You.**

Miro is a Free Software project and like all Free Software projects,
there are a variety of ways that you can be involved. By being involved
you are taking the responsibility to help solve your own problems.

You can
`test <https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/wiki/TestingDtv>`__
`nightly builds and release
candidates <http://participatoryculture.org/nightlies/>`__.

You can `submit bugs <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/>`__ and help us
triage and fix them.

You can `send in
patches <https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/>`__.
Patches can be for code, documentation, packaging, ...

You can `package Miro for other
distributions <https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/wiki/PackagingResources>`__.

You can `translate
strings <https://translations.launchpad.net/democracy>`__.

You can tell your friends and family about Miro and help them get setup.
You can blog about Miro. You can dent about Miro.

You can `adopt a line of code <https://getmiro.com/adopt/>`__. This
helps fund ongoing development. If we had more funds, we could have more
paid developers.

Miro is built and maintained by all of us working together contributing
our time and resources. There are features to be implemented, bugs to be
squashed, systems and software to integrate with, standards to
develop--the future is great with possibilities. There's a lot of stuff
that can be done and you can help the Miro community do it.
