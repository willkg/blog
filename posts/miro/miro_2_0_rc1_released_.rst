I built and posted Miro 2.0 rc1 builds in the sticky section of the
nightlies page
(`http://pculture.org/nightlies <http://pculture.org/nightlies/>`__).

We have a set of pre-release 2.0 release notes that still need updating
but are pretty up-to-date at
https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/wiki/2.0ReleaseNotes.

Please post any bugs to http://bugzilla.pculture.org/ with the version
as 2.0-rc1. Please include as much information as possible. See
`GoodBugReports <https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/wiki/GoodBugReports>`__
for more details.

To put this in some context, this is a HUGE release for us. We've been
working hard on Miro 2.0 since May or thereabouts. It's good to get to
the end of the development cycle. At the same time, there are things
we're leaving on the table that we'll address in future versions.

Last call for translation help--if you're a translator and familiar with
Launchpad, we could use your help!

I want to send a huge thank you for all the people who have contributed
to Miro development thus far especially people I've worked with like
Alex, Uwe, Keith, Pan, Robbt, Sedat, Lukasz, Arvid, Elmargol, and
others.

Also, thank you to my life partner, Sadie, who has put up with me fixing
bugs and doing a release candidate on my birthday.

Finally, happy birthday to me! w00t!
