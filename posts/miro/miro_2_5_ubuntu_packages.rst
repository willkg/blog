The Miro 2.5 release had a couple of issues that affected users with
large databases. We've been working on those issues and helping those
people out for the last couple of days. This work culminated in a Miro
2.5.1 release.

Because I was working out issues with Miro 2.5 release and helping users
work through issues (more on that in a future blog post), I haven't
worked on the Ubuntu packaging yet. My current plan is to wait until
Sunday (tomorrow) and do packages for Miro 2.5.1 skipping 2.5.

I apologize for not getting packages out sooner, but I:

#. was busy fixing Miro 2.5 issues and helping users
#. thought it'd be better to hold off until the Miro 2.5 issues were
   worked out
#. discovered World of Warcraft

If for some reason I can't/don't push out packages on Sunday, I promise
I will do them as soon as I can. I use Ubuntu, too, so this affects me
as well as all of you.

If for some reason this isn't satisfactory and you want/need it sooner
than I can provide, I encourage you to build your own Miro from source.
