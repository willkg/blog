I threw together a Planet using
`Venus <http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/>`__ for Miro-related blogs
(and other feeds). Like other Miro-related sites, the configuration and
templates are stored in SVN. It's currently set to update every 8 hours,
but we can change that if need be.

The mission of these dev blogs and planet miro is to keep everyone in
the loop on progress of Miro. Previously if you wanted to track
progress, you could hang out on IRC (``#miro-hackers`` on
``irc.freenode.net``), follow the `Trac
timeline <https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/timeline>`__,
and/or watch bugs change status in Bugzilla through searches. These
methods are good, but they don't follow the progress of a person or
groups of people, they're following the status changes of development
artifacts--the two things aren't necessarily the same. When I started in
July, I mentioned starting development blogs and a planet because I
think this has been wildly successful for other projects, but then ... I
never really got around to implementing the dream. Kudos to Dean for
getting the devblogs set up!

As a side note, when putting together the planet, I skimmed the `Miro
Testing blog <http://pculture.org/devblogs/mirotesting/>`__ and I
thought the entry from the 26th on `how do we grow the
community <http://pculture.org/devblogs/mirotesting/2007/09/26/miro-testing-how-do-we-grow-the-community/>`__
was both poignant and important. It's worth reading if you haven't
already.

**Updates:**

9/29/2007: Upon Dean's request, I changed the frequency of planet miro updates
to once an hour.
