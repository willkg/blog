Miro 4.0 status
(`roadmap <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/roadmap.cgi?product=Miro&target=4.0>`__)

* working on audio file metadata retrieval, storage, and ui
* working on device syncing
* working on performance enhancements for startup and displaying tabs
* working on extension framework
* switching testing from eggplant to sikuli

Paul:

* device syncing is looking good and is probably ready to land
* automated syncing of feeds doesn't quite work, yet, but it's getting
  there

Asheesh:

* got some MC work done--keeps bumping into access issues and other
  roadblocks
* wants to spend time with infrastructure to make things a lot easier
  going forward: deployment scripts, ...

Will:

* finished up the documentation I needed to do
* got most of the things in my queue done
* working on 3.5.1 bugs and moving build boxes upstairs

Kaz:

* started adding metadata items to the list view
* we need to figure out how to add metadata items to the item view, too

Geoffrey:

* did a lot of bug fixing on OSX
* worked on importing itunes data into Miro

Janet:

* started testing on new OSX version for MVC
* testing Miro 3.5.1 bug fixes
* worked on Miro Community documentation and testing
* worked on Universal Subtitles documentation and testing
* Litmus is broken--sent emails to admin, but haven't heard anything
  from it
* one PC broke (Ubuntu and Windows 7 and Windows Vista and Windows XP)
  and eggplant tests

Ben:

* worked on 3.5.1 bug fixes
* fixed a bunch of playback issues
* having a hell of a time tracking the VLC crash problem down

Official business:

* talked about coding standards/conventions/etc; we have a document and
  it needs some additional bits covering utf-8/unicode/filename
  handling
* talked about swapping out flashscraper for vidscraper for Miro 4.0;
  this would fix the problem where downloading a single item from
  YouTube and other video hosting sites doesn't get useful metadata; it
  should get done, but probably in January
* talked about how to notify the user about things they can do with
  Miro in a context-specific way
* Miro is developed by a community of people including you! If you
  can't contribute your time and work, please consider contributing
  funding by `donating <https://www.miroguide.com/donate>`__. Your
  money goes directly to ongoing development of Miro and related

* Did you know there's a Miro User Manual? If you haven't looked at it
  yet, it's worth taking a look at. You can find it at
  http://getmiro.com/userguide/.
