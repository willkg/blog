  implementing feed:// and feeds:// support at the command line

This coming week I'm:

- Working on bugs
  `9523 <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9523>`__,
  `9521 <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9521>`__ and
  `5403 <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5403>`__
- Getting a Mac-mini for Boston devs for testing/development
- Visiting the Worcester office on Thursday, February 7th

It's been a good week overall. The Firefox 3 B3 codefreeze is tonight
and I think I'm on track for landing all three patches, but they haven't
landed yet (as of this writing). We'll see what happens tonight.

**Updates:**

All three patches landed. The one for 400061 had some
issues, but myk fixed them and landed it for me.
