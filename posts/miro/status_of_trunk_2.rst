First off, sorry that this status update is so late--I was side tracked
on Wednesday and then the status slipped my mind.

In the last week and a half, there's been a lot of progress in trunk.
While we haven't re-implemented everything yet, we're doing pretty well.

You can follow along in your story book `with the Trac
timeline <https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/timeline>`__.

I really appreciate your patience. I think we've got another few days to
a week before testing builds is useful where "useful" is defined as
"you'll start having a good chance of catching things we don't already
know about".
