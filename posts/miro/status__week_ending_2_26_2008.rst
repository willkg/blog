It was an exciting week:

* Bought a new laptop (Dell 1420n with Ubuntu Gutsy on it, 4 GB of
  memory and BRIGHT YELLOW)
* Spent a couple of days switching to the new laptop and getting VNC
  working on my desktop machine
* Worked on bugs
  `9614 <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9614>`__,
  `9627 <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9627>`__ and
  `3067 <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3067>`__--`9627 <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9627>`__
  took me a while to figure out
* Centralized the list of projects for internships, GSOC, et al -- see
  it at
  https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/wiki/CommunityProjects
* Toyed with Hardy Heron alpha 5 for a few hours to get a feel for
  where we are with that; turns out Miro 1.1.2 is in the Hardy
  repositories, so that's a good sign

This coming week I'm planning to:

* Work on 1.2 bugs starting with mine and continuing with Nassar's
* Take a look at the two-stage problem with the subscribe.getmiro.com
  site

I want to send HUGE thank yous to the following people:

* mutantmonkey for the patch which disables the x screensaver for
  GTKX11 when watching movies in fullscreen -- this is awesome!
* Njaal for the patch so that Miro will automatically stop seeding
  torrents when a specified ratio is reached in bug
  `8793 <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8793>`__
* Sid for the excellent bug report for
  `9627 <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9627>`__
* elmargol for help with bug
  `9614 <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9614>`__
* Uwe from Debian and Christopher from Ubuntu for the work they're
  doing and the help they give us on packaging

Also, I'd like to apologize for posting my last status so late. I
back-dated it, so it probably showed up on the planet pretty low.
