This is a first post as I get used to the WordPress interface....

I'm a developer at `Participatory Culture
Foundation <http://pculture.org/>`__ and I work full-time on Miro
development. Currently I'm working on Mediabar which is a Firefox
extension that discovers media on a web-page and allows you to send
selected media to media applications like iTunes, Miro, VLC, ....

My plan is to post status-type posts on this blog as well as short
essays on various development issues that I come across. This gives
readers a window into my development progress so that things are more
transparent.

I'm using `Planet Mozilla <http://planet.mozilla.org/>`__ as
inspiration.

That about covers it. If you're interested in other kinds of content,
comment below and I'll see what I can do.
