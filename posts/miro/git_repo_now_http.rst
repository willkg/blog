We switched the miro repository url from
**https**://git.participatoryculture.org/miro/ to
**http**://git.participatoryculture.org/miro/. If you were using https,
then you should switch the origin url in the ``.git/config`` file. It's
unlikely that's the case, though, since it's been broken for over a
month now.
