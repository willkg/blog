On May 20th, we released Miro 4.0 rc2.  This has a few known issues, but
we've fixed a ton of stuff since rc1.  We're 2 days away from tagging
a final build.  Please upgrade to rc2 and help us test it out.

Specifically, we need your help testing:

* using Miro to sync media between Miro and your Android device
* using Miro to stream through DAAP to other DAAP clients on 
  your network
* Miro on Windows

Miro 4.0 rc2 builds are located on the
`nightlies page <http://nightlies.pculture.org/>`_
in the Sticky Files section.

Note that this is not a final release release!  There are still some problems
and tweaks we're working on.

Also, we really need help with translations.  If you know multiple languages,
please help us translate.  On Launchpad, there's a `Miro section for translations
<https://translations.launchpad.net/democracy>`_.

Also, if you help with testing and translation, please let me know
so I can gleefully add you to the credits where you rightfully belong!

If you haven't helped before, now is a good chance to jump in and make
your mark!  Only 2 days left!
