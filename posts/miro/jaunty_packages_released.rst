I finished up a set of Miro 2.0.4 packages for Jaunty for amd64 and
i386, pushed them out, and updated our download instructions page.

Two things to clarify:

#. In the Ubuntu universe repository are Miro 2.0.3 packages, but these
   packages have a backported patch from Miro 2.0.4 so they're
   essentially equivalent to the 2.0.4 packages I just built.
#. I put out PCF-built packages because we support Ubuntu and not
   because Iain and others aren't doing a fantastic job packaging Miro
   for Ubuntu.

I'm sorry it took so long, but I was gone most of last week, so I was a
bit late to the party.

I'm currently working on getting Miro in trunk to work with Jaunty...
there are a few other issues that need to be worked out still.

Instructions for installing the PCF-built Miro 2.0.4 packages are at
`<http://www.getmiro.com/download/for-ubuntu/>`__.

Going forward I'll continue to build packages for Hardy, Intrepid and
Jaunty. I'm no longer building packages for older versions of Ubuntu.
