I just removed the `!miro group <http://identi.ca/group/177/id>`__
`identi.ca <http://identi.ca/>`__ feed from `Planet
GetMiro <http://planet.getmiro.com/>`__. There isn't much compelling
stuff in it plus all the things I was denting are now in my blog feed
since I'm aggregating my dents there.

I made this decision on my own without consulting anyone. If this
bothers you, let me know either in the comments or send me an email.
