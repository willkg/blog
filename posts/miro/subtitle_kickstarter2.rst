As of September 11th, there are only 10 people in the world who are
interested in subtitle support in Miro enough to contribute to it. Is
that right? Were we completely mistaken in thinking that users want
subtitle support?

If subtitle support in Miro is important to you, take the time to
`contribute
now <http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1116615214/subtitles-in-miro-translations-and-support-for-t>`__.
If you live in the United States, donations/contributions are
tax-deductible because PCF is a 501c3 non-profit company.

Also, help us get the word out. Write about it on your blog, dent it,
digg it, reddit it, ... Help us make it happen. Help us help you.
