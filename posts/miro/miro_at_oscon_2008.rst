I'm heading to `OSCON
2008 <http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/home>`__ and will
be hanging out in the Mozilla booth talking about Miro things, Mozilla
things, happy things, and whatever other things.

When I'm not hanging in the Mozilla booth, I'm hoping to be doing some
Miro hacking (and possibly some
`PyBlosxom <http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/>`__ hacking--we shall
see).

I'll be wearing Miro and Miro-related t-shirts until I run out. Then
I'll be wearing other things.

If you're planning to be at OSCON, stop by the Mozilla booth and talk to
me about things you like, things you dislike, and favorite channels. I'm
also very interested in helping people learn how to help out.
