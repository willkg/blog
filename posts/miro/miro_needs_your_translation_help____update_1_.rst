I imported translation updates today. Anything done in since the 22nd
should be available in tonight's nightlies.

Since I originally posted this cry for help four days ago, twelve of the
languages have been edited.

We now have four completed translations:

* German
* Finnish
* Slovenian
* Norwegian Nynorsk

Bravo!

We've got five more that are getting close:

* Norwegian Bokmal
* Polish
* French
* Swedish
* Spanish

The rest of the languages have more than 100 untranslated strings.

If there's anything I can do to help you out, let me know. If you know
anyone else that can help with translations, I sure would appreciate the
help!
