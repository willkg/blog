I spent the last week pawning bugs off on other people while I come up
to speed with Firefox development. Alex Faaborg wrote a blog entry
`about Firefox and
Miro <https://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2007/10/08/firefox-and-miro/>`__
which piqued our interest. The result of the conversations around that
blog entry launched me into Firefox development.

My first impression is that Mozilla has a massive code base. They've got
a lot of code for a lot of products and they're managing it with an
intricate series of make files and scripts. It has taken a while to come
up to speed and I'm still spending time figuring things out. I've
written some loose notes about getting started with Firefox
development on my other blog. As a side note, it's tough having two blogs.

Today Alex formalized the issues into `bug
400059 <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=400059>`__.

I spent Saturday at the `Ubuntu Massachusetts Install
Fest <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MassachusettsTeam/Events/InstallFests/2007-10-13>`__
which went fantastically. I talked to a bunch of people about Miro,
Ubuntu and Free Software. Most people I talked to either hadn't heard of
Miro at all or had heard of it, but didn't realize we had changed the
name. I'm not sure what that means in the grand scheme of things, but
everyone was pretty interested in the current state of the project.

This coming Friday is the start of `PodCamp Boston
2 <http://podcamp.pbwiki.com/PodCampBoston2>`__. Dean, possibly Chris,
and I are going to attend some/many/most of the days and talk to people
about the Miro ecosystem. Dean's also talked to Chris Brogan about
making the sessions available as a feed somewhere so that we can turn it
into a channel and put it on the Miro Guide. I'm not a big fan of tech
evangelism, but I think telling people about the Miro ecosystem is
generally a good thing for everyone involved. It's good for us for the
obvious reasons. It's good for content producers because it's important
for them to understand the publishing side of the equation and that they
don't have to be tied down to a host/publisher. It's important for the
rest of the world because the more people realize they have options, the
more those options continue to exist and the less likely it is that
unpopular voices are muted. That's some serious stuff.

I think I'm going to spend the coming week continuing work on the
Firefox patch and poking around with the Firefox code base. I suspect
things will slow down a bit as I start asking more questions and waiting
for answers. That'll give me time to continue working on the Mediabar.

As a side note, I'm now using Firefox 3.0 dev--it's pretty interesting.

**Updates:**

10-21-2007: I got this weekend confused with next weekend.
Not quite sure how I did that. Next weekend (26th-28th) is PodCamp and
FOSSCamp. It was a good thing, too, because I spent this weekend pushing
out 0.9.9.9 rc0 and upgrading my laptop to Gutsy.
