Earlier today or yesterday (time goes so fast these days I can't
remember when I did what), I added `Chris'
blog <http://dustycloud.org/blog/>`__ to the planet.

He's been contributing to Miro development for a while now and I
mentioned him in a `previous
post <http://pculture.org/devblogs/wguaraldi/2008/08/08/status-trunk-4/>`__.
It's good to have him on the team in a more permanent fashion.
