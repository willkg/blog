One of the things I've been working on over the last couple of weeks was
a new desk and deskspace for my PCF branch office where I work.
It's been hard because I have a bunch of equipment that I need access
to, as well as a bunch of paperwork and other things. Also, I felt my
desk was too short for my height--I was always feeling scrunched up.
Also also, my desk had a privacy guard and I have a bruise on the front
of each shin from whacking the damned privacy guard all the time. I
really really needed a different desk.

One night, I drew up plans. Two weekends ago, I visited my dad and we
took his Suburban to Home Depot, picked up some material, brought it
back to his place where he has more space, and made the cuts. Then we
brought it back to my place where I spent the last couple of weeks
sanding it, staining it and poly-urethaning it.

Today I finished it up, assembled it, moved everything around, and put
it in place.

I put the PCF build boxes under the desk where I can kick them when I'm
annoyed. :)

Many thanks to my dad for all his help and my brother-in-law for his
thoughts. I'm really psyched to have a better desk. It'll clear up a lot
of problems I was having.
