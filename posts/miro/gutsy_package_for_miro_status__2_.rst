Someone (possibly Janet) created a gutsy keyword in Bugzilla, so I went
through and tagged all the bugs that I think are gutsy related with the
gutsy keyword: `<http://bugzilla.pculture.org/buglist.cgi?keywords=gutsy>`__.

There are a few other issues floating around that are related to our
feisty packaging--I'm going to try to fix those while I'm fiddling with
packaging.

I've copied over the debian-feisty packaging to debian-gutsy in the
repository. Today I'm working on getting the kinks out of building,
going through all the files to make sure they work, and testing the
resulting package.

Once I get to a point where the resulting package is building and stable
on both of my machines, I'll post the packages for other people to test.

That's where I am with things. I imagine this will be an all-day thing.

I'll post something here when I have a 0.9.9.9-rc0 gutsy package ready
for testing and solicit help in regards to testing from the people who
have been posting bugs.

Any thoughts, suggestions, et al--comment below.
