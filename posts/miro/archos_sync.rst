Sedatg pointed out the `archos-sync
project <http://nikosapi.org/wiki/index.php/Archos-Sync>`__. It's a
script that syncs the content between his Archos media player and Miro.
More information at that link.

If anyone was interested in helping out on a syncing project to sync
Miro content with devices, that's probably a good one to help out with.

Anyone else know of similar projects that are building software to sync
Miro content, convert content or port Miro to smaller devices? If so,
please add a comment. The more exposure to these projects, the better.
