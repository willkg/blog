I've been working at PCF for three years now. I think that officially
makes me an old-timer. I can start sentences with, "I remember the day
when..."

I mentioned that to Paul, who also just hit his three year anniversary,
and he suggested the sentence, "I remember the day when ... we had an
office."

I was thinking along the lines of, "I remember the day when to implement
a ui change, you had to do it three times and on Windows, you had to do
it in Python and then again in JavaScript."
