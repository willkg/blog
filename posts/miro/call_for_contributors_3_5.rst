For many contributions, there's "paperwork" that sticks around allowing
me to programmatically figure out who has helped out. For example, the
author field in git checkins, reporters/commenters in bugzilla, ...

For other things (translations, testing, ...), I don't have a good way
to programmatically figure out who's helped out, who's participated,
who's worked with me and other contributors to Miro's development to
make Miro as awesome as we can make it.

Going forward, I'll continue to work on making sure that we're doing a
good job of crediting everyone who worked on a release because other
projects do it and we should be doing it to.

For this release, I want to make sure we credit everyone. If you've
contributed to Miro development, let me know because I want to include
you in the CREDITS file and other places. Either leave a comment or send
me an email.

If you read this entry (and :doc:`the previous one <translations_miro_3_5>`,
please dent it, tweet it, and mention it wherever you can so that we can
credit as close to everyone we can as possible. Thank you!
