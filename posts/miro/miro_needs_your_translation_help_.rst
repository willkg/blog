We've been pushing hard on Miro 2.0 development for a long time now. So
far I've avoided making release date predictions, but looking at the
Bugzilla queue and the rate at which we're finishing things, we're
probably looking at a Miro 2.0 release in the next 3 or 4 weeks.

One thing that we desperately need help with is translation work. All
translation work is done in Launchpad at
https://translations.launchpad.net/democracy/trunk/+pots/democracyplayer.
You can see the status of translations there, too. Right now it looks
something like this:

::

   language    # untranslated strings
   --------    ----------------------
   German      0 (Go German!)
   Slovenian   28
   Polish      39
   Swedish     58
   French      66

The rest of the languages have more than 100 untranslated strings.

I want to thank Lukasz, who's been working on the Polish translations,
for helping an enormous amount in the last few weeks. He's identified
and helped me fix a bunch of problems with the strings and also worked
to make the strings easier to translate. Thank you!

If you can translate strings and/or have done Launchpad translations
before, we need your help. We've got a 3 or 4 week window between now
(January 22nd 2009) and a release. It's not a lot of time, but hopefully
it's enough time for us all to get translations into a better state.

If you have any questions or find any problems, let me know.
