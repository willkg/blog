It was a really great day today. Talked with Songbird and Thunderbird
people about our projects in relation to contributors and outside
contributions.

There's a lot of interest in a plugin system for Miro--it's definitely
on my list of things to work on in the near future. There's also a lot
of interest in a user interface that's tv-friendly. That's something I
think about a lot, but it's not something in my immediate queue.

I talked to Dave Camp on the work he's doing on the new embedding API
for Gecko--it sounds pretty cool.

Met a lot of happy Miro users. There are a lot of people out there
rooting us on which is very exciting. :)

That's the end of OSCON for me. I'm going to spend Friday hanging out
with my sister and then I fly back on Saturday. It's a pretty incredible
conference all things considered. Met a lot of great people doing a lot
of really fantastic work. It's very inspiring. :)
