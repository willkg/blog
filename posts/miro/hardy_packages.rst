I updated my AMD64 machine to Hardy today and built a set of Miro 1.2.3
packages for Hardy AMD64. Going forward, I'll continue to build packages
for Gutsy and Hardy for both i386 and AMD64 platforms.

Miro 1.2.3 is the last release I'll be doing packages for Dapper and
Feisty.

If someone could help out by maintaining and testing packages for those
two platforms and any others that we don't cover, that'd be really
great. Let me know in the comments, by email, or on IRC.
