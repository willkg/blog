I'm at `FUDCON10 <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon/FUDConF10>`__
right now (Thursday, 6/19/2008). I'm interested in meeting people here
and talking about Miro and `Fedora TV <http://fedoratv.com/>`__. If
you're here, come find me. I'm currently hanging out in the main FUDCON
room in the corner all by myself. ;)
