How do you contribute to Miro development?

Do you
`test <https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/wiki/TestingDtv>`__
`nightly builds and release
candidates <http://participatoryculture.org/nightlies/>`__?

Do you `submit bugs <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/>`__ and help us fix
them?

Do you `send in
patches <https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/>`__?

Do you `package Miro for other
distributions <https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/wiki/PackagingResources>`__?

Do you `translate
strings <https://translations.launchpad.net/democracy>`__?

Do you tell your friends and family about Miro and help them set it up?
Do you blog about Miro?

Did you `adopt a line of code <https://getmiro.com/adopt/>`__?

Miro is built and maintained by all of us working together contributing
our time and resources. There are features to be implemented, bugs to be
squashed, systems and software to integrate with, standards to
develop--the future is great with possibilities.

We at `PCF <http://pculture.org/>`__ are testing out feature-focused
support to help pay our operating costs. We're going to pick a feature
every release and turn it into a project on
`Kickstarter <http://kickstarter.com/>`__. If the feature that we picked
is important to you, then pledge and help PCF help you. These aren't
little features--they're big projects that implement functionality
that's often requested.

For the next next release, we're working on subtitles. If subtitle
support is important to you, then `check out the project
page <http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1116615214/subtitles-in-miro-translations-and-support-for-t>`__
and pledge your support. Help PCF continue its work on Miro. Help me and
the other PCF developers help you.
