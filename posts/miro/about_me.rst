I'm a Miro developer employed by Participatory Culture Foundation.

**What I do:**

I spend my Miro-development hours testing, release engineering, doing
some release planning, doing Linux and Windows development, working on
enhancements, fixing bugs, and Ubuntu support, packaging and testing. I
also do some bug triage, user support, and "public relations" (i.e.
hanging out with content creators and content publishers and explaining
how the Miro universe fits into their world). I think I'm averaging
between 40 an 60 hours a week for work but my wife insists it's a lot
more than that. I haven't had the courage to measure it, yet--some
things are probably best left unquantified.

**Ways that you can get a hold of me:**

``will dot guaraldi at pculture dot org``

**Meet me for coffee:**

I live near Boston, MA, USA right off of the T. I'd love to hang out,
get a cup of coffee, and talk Miro and Miro-related things. If you're in
the area, definitely look me up.

I'd also love to do Miro or Miro-related hackfests. If you're
interested, let me know.

**The rest of my world:**

My other web-site is at
`http://bluesock.org/~willg/ <http://bluesock.org/~willkg/>`__.

I'm the maintainer of `PyBlosxom <http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/>`__.
I've been doing some GSOC and GHOP work with the Python Software
Foundation.

I started a co-working group called `Nomadic Telecommuting
Herd <http://herd.jottit.com/>`__ which grows linearly with respects to
how much time I put into it which comes in spurts.
