Luc landed detached playback a little over a week ago in r8282 (and a
bunch of checkins before that).

The interface for it is a little rough and might change a bit over the
next few weeks. It's something a lot of people have mentioned they
wanted--`David Ascher <http://ascher.ca/blog/>`__ gave me a stern
talking to about it at OSCON 2008. It's going to be a kick-ass Miro 2.0
feature.

I need to spend some time to get it working fully on Linux and Windows,
but most of the code is there now and it works pretty well on OSX. w00t!
