**Me for the next week**

I'm going on a service trip for a week to help out rebuilding and such.
When I get back, I'll be spending quality time with Miro on Ubuntu
Jaunty, Python 2.6 and a bunch of other support issues that have popped
up and I'll be back on Miro development duty helping Ben and Luc with
the changes going into Miro 2.1.

**Call for help**

Also, if you are technical and use Gentoo, Arch Linux, or OpenSUSE, toss
me a line either in the comments below, on ``#miro-hackers`` on
``irc.freenode.net`` or by email at
``will.guaraldi at pculture dot org``. I'd really like to get help on
supporting these three systems better for Miro--I just can't do it
myself.
