**note**

I wasn't on the call for 10/7/2009, so I don't have notes for that day.

**minutes**

Will:

* Planning to push 2.5.3 out.
* Planning to keep working on extracting binary kit stuff.
* Then get miro working on Karmic Koala.
* Then moving libtorrent out of portable.
* Will be in Providence, RI from October 23rd through 26th.

Luc:

* Continuing work on subtitle work.
* Perian doesn't support subtitles in subfolders. Luc is looking into
  fixing Perian and then sending a patch upstream.
* Luc is going to start looking into VLC support next.

Ben:

* Planning to work on 12101. One of the theories is that when torrents
  are downloading, Miro is doing a lot of disk thrashing.
* Remove torrent metadata from the updates.
* Tweak status so that we only persist to disk every now and then.
* Plans to work on bug 12229.
* It's difficult to figure out how many people are affected by 12101.

Paul:

* Working on Miro Community 0.8 release. It's coming along nicely.

Janet:

* Tested Miro Community and Miro 2.5 branch builds.
* Working on testing plans for Miro Community post 0.8 release.

2.5.3 status:

* Talked about 12277 and 12276 and where we're going with that plan.
* Hopefully we'll get it out today or tomorrow.
