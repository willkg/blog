Short status this week....

I took Wednesday through Saturday off.

On Monday, I fiddled with my Windows build environment and finally got
it working (again) on Tuesday. I was having problems getting fasttypes
to compile. I was getting all kinds of errors when going through the
boost stuff. After some skulking through Google results regarding boost
compilation problems, I decided to try installing Visual Studio 7.1
without installing the service pack. That worked super--though I'm not
entirely sure why. I updated the WindowsBuildDocs page with new urls and
tried to break up the instructions into something that's more
digestible.

I also continued to work on the Firefox patch.
