This actually covers two weeks of work because I was in Florida for a
bit in between.

Things I did:

* implemented
  `5403 <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5403>`__ and
  `8619 <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8619>`__ for
  GTKX11 and Windows
* worked on Mediabar specs (briefly)
* went to the Worcester office to hang out with the Nicks
* bought a Mac mini for Boston devs
* wrote a blog entry about the Firefox 3 work I did so it's clearer as
  to what I was working on and how it impacts Miro
* did a 1.1.2 release which contains the exception text for OpenSSL and
  GPL co-existence (though it's not entirely clear if I did this right)
* did some bug-fixing on GTKX11 to get the timebar and video
  information displaying correctly
* did some re-working of the theme I'm using on my devblog so it's less
  annoying--still needs some help, though

Things I'm working on this week:

* finishing up work on bugs
  `5403 <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5403>`__ and
  `8619 <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8619>`__ (though
  I may end up giving up--I'm not really following where oid comes from
  in the strings)
* go through the bugs and do some more light triage work and start
  marking bugs that look bite-sized as such
