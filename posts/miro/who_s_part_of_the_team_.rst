I saw the `Our wonderful
team <http://www.getmiro.com/blog/2009/02/our-wonderful-team/>`__ post
just now. The PCF staff is great and, but "the team" constitutes a much
larger group of great people without whom the magic could never happen.

There are hackers like Uwe, Nathan, Zach, Michael and others who have
sent in patches that add new features, add test cases, and fix bugs.

There are testers like Keith, Pan, Sedat, Robbt, Sumana, and dozens of
others whose work directly impacts the quality of Miro.

There are bug reporters who spend their time helping us work out complex
problems that result in fixes and better experiences for future users.
Some of these bug reports and comments are simply awe-inspiring.

There are translators like Karl, Lukasz, and Sedat who through their
efforts have done some great translation work and also fixed issues
smoothing the path for other translators.

There are packagers like Uwe (Debian), Iain (Ubuntu), Christian
(Ubuntu), Alex (Fedora) and others that I'm either forgetting or haven't
interacted with who package Miro for other distributions, send bugs and
fixes upstream to us, and help us generalize the code so that it works
on as many systems as possible.

There are developers of libraries that Miro uses like Arvid who works on
libtorrent, lurks on our bug system and IRC, and helps us with
libtorrent issues.

There are developers and members of other projects that are actively
seeking areas where we can help each other build better things like
Nathan and Asheesh from Creative Commons, Gabriel Burt from Banshee, and
Chris Blizzard, Aza Dotzler, and others from Mozilla.

There are thousands of users who use Miro, find and report issues, tell
their friends about Miro, wax on about the importance of an open
Internet and open media distribution, and give feedback that molds
future versions of Miro.

There are thousands of content producers who benefit from and add to the
infrastructure that we're helping to facilitate.

This massive group of people is the team. The best part is that the team
is getting bigger and better every day.
