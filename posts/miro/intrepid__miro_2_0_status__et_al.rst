First off, I put together a set of amd64 packages for Ubuntu
Intrepid--they're in our repository now.

Second, I want to point out that after working and playing with what
will become Miro 2.0, it's really hard to go back and develop on and
play with the Miro 1.2 series. We've done a lot of work on the Miro
codebase improving it, refactoring it, adding unit tests, re-writing the
user interface, fixing behavior, and adding new features (detached
playback ftw!).

We still have a handful of things that Miro 1.2.8 did that Miro 2.0
doesn't do yet, but the list gets shorter every week. We also have a
bunch of bugs that need to be looked at and worked on and some polish
that needs to happen.

You can see the list of things we're working on
`here <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&product=Miro&target_milestone=2.0&long_desc_type=substring&long_desc=&bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_file_loc=&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&status_whiteboard=&keywords_type=allwords&keywords=&deadlinefrom=&deadlineto=&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&priority=P1&priority=P2&priority=P3&emailassigned_to1=1&emailtype1=substring&email1=&emailassigned_to2=1&emailreporter2=1&emailcc2=1&emailtype2=substring&email2=&bugidtype=include&bug_id=&votes=&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&cmdtype=doit&order=Reuse+same+sort+as+last+time&field0-0-0=noop&type0-0-0=noop&value0-0-0=>`__.
It's loosely prioritized--we're spending more time trying to get things
tested and fixed than we are in mothering over the bug data. There are
85 bugs in the queue of things to do. To put that in some perspective,
we've fixed over 350 bugs so far.

I want to thank Jason who interned with us over the summer. It was great
to work with him and his contributions to the Miro project were really
helpful. Also, he was instrumental in making the Miro monster. I hope
they put it up on Etsy or some other online shop because they're
awesome!

I want to thank Pan, Davide, Bill, Markus, and Sedat for their work
testing Miro over the last couple of months. Their efforts are
invaluable and very much appreciated.
