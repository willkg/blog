Miro 4.0 has a credits list that lists all the people that have helped
us with all the things that went into the Miro 4.0 release cycle.

Part of the list is automatically generated from Bugzilla and git data
(authors, bug reporters, bug commenters, ...).

However, there's a lot of work that people do that isn't easily divulged
from Bugzilla and git.

If you're wondering whether you're on the list already, install Miro 4.0
rc1 and look at the About Miro dialog--the list is there.

If you helped with Miro 4.0 and you're not on the list, send me an email
before Friday so that I can add you to the list.

If your name is in the list, but you want it written differently, send
me an email before Friday.

Thank you in advance for your work however trivial you may think it was
on Miro 4.0.  It is a project of many hands.
