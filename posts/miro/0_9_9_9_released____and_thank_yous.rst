We released 0.9.9.9 yesterday and it took us 5 or 6 hours from tagging
the branch to releasing builds. That's pretty cool and makes for a
smooth release. Also, I didn't screw anything up this time. :)

I'm an employee of PCF so it's my job to work on Miro (and the other
things I work on). However, I'm just one guy and time is a limited
resource. There's no way I can triage, identify and fix all bugs. I
appreciate all the help that I can get. I had a bunch of help this
release.

I wanted to thank the following people for the time they spent
submitting quality bugs, sending in patches, and helping me fix issues:

* Simon from dbus-python who walked me through fixing the dbus-python
  deprecation issue and reviewed the code changes I made.
* Markus who helped me with a variety of Gutsy and Gutsy packaging
  issues.
* Paul who noticed our README was out of date and suggested changes.
* Matthias who helped with Gutsy and Feisty packaging issues.
* Gotz who helped with packaging issues.
* St√©phane who helped with packaging issues.
* Marco who helped with packaging issues.

If there's anyone else that helped out that I've forgotten, I apologize.
Please kick me and/or comment below.

We're well on the path to a solid 1.0. When 1.0 is finally out, we start
working through the architecture changes required for many of the
features that have been suggested.
