I'm starting a new category of my devblog where I'll mention what's just
landed in trunk. This does two things:

#. it forces me to keep track of what's landing in trunk
#. it's an easier to digest view of things than `Trac timeline of
   svn <https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/timeline>`__
#. it'll let people know what's in the pipe
#. it gives people who are tracking trunk a vague idea of stability
   levels

I'll start blogging interesting things landing in trunk with their
revision numbers and probably break it down into bug fixes,
enhancements, and misc stuff.

Any thoughts, suggestions, et al--toss them in the comments.
