Ben:

* 6 bugs, some of them pretty icky, some should block and some shouldn't

Kaz:

* 4 bugs, 3 hours of work or so

Geoffrey:

* 1 bug, waiting for more information, shouldn't block an rc2
* working on OSX Lion support, looks like it might be fine without
  too many issues

Jonas:

* 1 bug, but it shouldn't block rc2

Will:

* 0 bugs, working on Miro User Manual updates and end-of-dev cycle
  stuff, will pick up P1 bugs as needed

  translations, please consider contributing funding by `donating
