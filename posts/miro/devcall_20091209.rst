2.6 status
(`roadmap <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/roadmap.cgi?product=Miro&target=2.6>`__)

* subtitle work is almost done
* lots of bugs to work on, but some might have been fixed in
  2.5.4--Janet is going to retest
* lots of little bugs to work on left--we could use the help if anyone
  is interested in contributing!

Paul

* Worked on Miro Community 0.8.5. It's pretty close to done--there are
  two outstanding bugs.
* Hoping to push out Miro Community 0.8.5 out in the next few days.
  Lots of bug fixes, cool new administration stuff.
* After that, there are a few big bugs for 0.9 to work on.

Janet

* Worked on getting 2.5.4 out. Looks like it's been a good release with
  few complaints.
* Working on figuring out the shutdown crash for Miro on Windows. This
  has been difficult and very trial-and-error.
* Worked on Miro Community testing.

Ben

* Worked with Janet on that shutdown crash.

Luc

* Worked on Miro 2.6 issues from bugzilla. Just kind of going through
  and cherry-picking easy issues and nasty issues.
