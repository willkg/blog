Podcasts come and go. I thought I'd do an update on things I watch and
list the podcasts I'm currently testing with.

* `The Ben Heck Show <http://revision3.com/tbhs>`__ (`Add to
  Miro <http://subscribe.getmiro.com/?url1=http%3A//revision3.com/tbhs/feed/MP4-hd30>`__)
  - TBHS is really fun to watch, educational, and really fun to watch.
  Ben spends each episode on a project such as a Super Can Cooler, a
  Portal Shirt, a Portable CNC Router, ... It's just fascinating.
* `Lawrence Lessig's blip.tv <http://lessig.blip.tv/>`__ (`Add to
  Miro <http://subscribe.getmiro.com/?url1=http://lessig.blip.tv/rss>`__)
  - Lawrence Lessig talks about corruption of money in politics and
  occasionally about copyright reform.
* `Wait wait... don't tell
  me! <http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=35>`__
  (`Add to
  Miro <http://subscribe.getmiro.com/?type=audio&url1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2Frss%2Fpodcast%2Fpodcast_detail.php%3FsiteId%3D5183214>`__)
  - "Wait wait... don't tell me!" is a radio show that I like listening
  to on the weekends, but I often miss it. So I subscribe to the
  podcast and get to listen to it when it's convenient for me.
* `Onion News Network <http://www.miroguide.com/feeds/1838>`__ (`Add to
  Miro <http://subscribe.getmiro.com/?url1=http%3A//feeds.theonion.com/OnionNewsNetwork&trackback1=http%3A//www.miroguide.com/feeds/1838/subscribe-hit&section1=video>`__)
  - ONN is just too funny. The videos are short, so they download
  quickly. The content is fantastic. They produce new content with
  great frequency. It's a great podcast to test with.
* `Python Miro Community <http://python.mirocommunity.org/>`__ (`Add to
  Miro <http://subscribe.getmiro.com/?url1=http%3A//python.mirocommunity.org/feeds/new/>`__)
  - This is the New feed for Python Miro Community. This is a site that
  has a curated index of Python-related videos around the Internet. It
  has conference videos from conferences like the various PyCons,
  DjangoCons, and PyOhio. Since I program primarily in Python, this
  feed helps me continue my Python education. It's an invaluable
  resource. (I also run the site.)
