I'm surprised that `Ben's
post <http://pculture.org/devblogs/bdk/2009/04/01/41/>`__ didn't garner
any response. I thought there was a significant number of people
chomping at the bit for these db changes.

If you're one of the people that was looking forward to these changes
but wasn't aware they were happening, then definitely take a look at
trunk. If there are use-cases you have that you don't think are going to
be handled, let us know as soon as possible.
