I apologize for skipping last week's status of trunk.

Trunk is still unstable. I consider "trunk is stable" to mean that most
things are re-implemented and it's usable. We're not quite there yet.
I'm seeing occasional crashers (most of them my fault so far), there are
a bunch of features that haven't been re-implemented (site search,
channel search, playing through a playlist, setting preferences, ...),
and there's still ui nits that need ironing out.

We're moving along, though it seems as if the progress comes in waves
during the week. I think part of this is that we're all using git over
svn and batching commits. I know I am.

I was gone all last week at OSCON, but I'm back again to help out with
the push to Miro 2.0.

You can follow along in your story book `with the Trac
timeline <https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/timeline>`__.
