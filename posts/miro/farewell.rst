Getting a job at PCF was a bit of a surreal experience.  It was in
July of 2007.  I had just had a major health crisis, wrote a compiler,
finished grad school, and got married.  I bumped into Chris at a
contra dance in Concord and on a lark and out of the clear blue sky,
my wife asked if he knew anyone hiring Python developers.  That's how
I ended up at PCF.

That was a little over four years ago.  It's been a really great four
years.  Working for PCF is pretty close to a dream job for me: I
learned a ton of stuff, I worked on a lot of awesome software, and I
worked with and met a lot of amazing people.  The hardest part of the
whole thing was that there were too many opportunities and I had to
pick and choose between the ones I had time for.  For example, I would
have loved to continue working on the extension system, the fullscreen
10' interface, the text-based interface, DLNA support, dbus 
interface, ....

Thus, with so many things left undone, I'm kind of bummed that I'm
leaving.  Friday is my last day.

Next Tuesday, I start work at Mozilla in the webdev crew on the SUMO
team.

It'll be weird to leave the desktop application world behind for the
wild wild west of Internet applications.  Having said that, you could
say I'm returning to web development after a 10 year hiatus.  A ton of
stuff has changed since then (\\cheapshot{except possibly Internet
Explorer}).  This time I'm working with people who know the HTTP
related RFCs way better than I do.  That's both exciting and daunting.

So if you're having Miro problems and send me an email, I'll probably
direct you to someone else.  Miro is a fast moving project and my
knowledge of its dark secrets will ebb quickly.

The times they are a changing!
