I spent the day in the Mozilla booth in the Expo hall. I talked to 30 or
40 people, I think--after lunch it was kind of a blur; after dinner it
was definitely a blur since the expo hall was serving free beer (or
"free beer as in beer" as I said a couple of times which I thought was
pretty funny, but went over like a lead balloon). There are a lot of
Miro users at OSCON, a handful of people who have never heard of it, one
or two people that thought it was still named Democracy Player, and I
met Michael Frank who contributed code to Miro at some point before I
was with the project!

I also talked with a lot of Mozilla people who came and went over the
course of the day. Listening to Ben and Taras talk about static code
analysis was really exciting. I talked to Stephen, Peter and Rob from
`Songbird <http://getsongbird.com/>`__. We spent some time talking about
where Songbird and Miro overlap and what kinds of things we can work
together on. The immediate result of this is that I'm going to start
hanging out on their IRC channel and probably start looking over their
code base. Additionally, Peter is working on a system of identifying
media from RSS/Atom data. I'm hoping to help out since this is a problem
Miro has, too, for some feeds.

I also go to see Asheesh and Nathan from `Creative
Commons <http://creativecommons.org/>`__ and we had time to catch up on
life and projects.

I went to the BoF session on addons for XUL-based applications. We
talked about pain points in the extension-development process. Overall
it was really educational both from the standpoint of how to write
XUL-based application extensions as well as what kinds of things we need
to focus on when we create a Miro plugin system. Songbird has an
extension system--we should definitely look at what they've done given
that they're very close to us in application space. I also went to the
BoF session on the static analysis project Ben and Taras are working on.
Less because it's applicable to anything I'm probably ever going to do,
but more because it's just mind-bogglingly interesting. They call it
`Dehydra <http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Dehydra>`__.

That's it for today. Tomorrow should be interesting, too.
