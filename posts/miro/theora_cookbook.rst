The folks at `FLOSS Manuals <http://en.flossmanuals.net/>`__ put
together a `Theora
Cookbook <http://en.flossmanuals.net/TheoraCookbook>`__. It's a great
book that covers Theora and publishing video on the Internet.

It's definitely worth reading/skimming if you're interested in Open
Video, Theora, and the impending future of video on the Internet.
