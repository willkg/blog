I continued working on getting Miro 1.2 released. One thing we need to
do better is coordinate translations. I'll be working on fixing that
part of the release process for the next release cycle.

I also worked on getting Miro trunk to compile and work with xulrunner
1.9 and on Ubuntu Hardy. I finished this today and checked it in. It
seems ok, but definitely needs peer review from someone who's more
familiar with XPCOM.

I had a cup of coffee with `Nathan <http://yergler.net/>`__ from
`Creative Commons <http://creativecommons.org/>`__. He was out here
doing work somewhere at MIT and I live nearby so we got together. For
Miro 1.0, he implemented license extraction from RSS feeds. You can see
the end result of this when you see the "license" item in the feed item
details. When the publisher has license information in the feed, this
links to the license. When you watch video content on the Internet,
think about what roles you play in that content... Are you merely a
passive consumer? Can you take the content and remix it into new content
with new meaning? Can you share it with your friends? Can you post it
elsewhere? The license information answers these questions and more.
Thank you Nathan!

He and I talked about other areas where Miro and Creative Commons
intersect and then we talked about
`PyBlosxom <http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/>`__--another project I
work on.

Once Miro 1.2 is out, I'm going to go back to work on Mediabar. I'll
probably be working on that for the next week or two.
