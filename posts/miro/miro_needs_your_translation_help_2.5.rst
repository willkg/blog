Ben checked in a fix for database problems that occur when a user's disk
is full. This fix required the addition of 4 new strings. I really
apologize for making strings changes this late in the development cycle,
but we decided the fix was really important and that outweighed the
imperatives of the strings freeze.

We're on the brink of releasing Miro 2.5. It's something we're hoping to
do early next week--possibly Monday or Tuesday pending how Ben's changes
bake out.

Because of this, we really need help with translations. If you're a
translator, have done Miro translation work before, and/or know someone
who has, now's the time to spend some time with translations to ensure
that they're rock-solid for a Miro 2.5 release.
