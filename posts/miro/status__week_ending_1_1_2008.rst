I wasn't around for the last week. I got home last night and spent today
recovering from some flu I've been fighting for the last week and also
continuing work with building a pbuilder environment for Gutsy and
friends.

Tomorrow I plan on finishing up the pbuilder stuff and working on the
Firefox patches, but ... I don't think I have much of a chance of
finishing them in time, so I think I may put it on the backburner and
help out with Miro 1.1 and continuing development. Then work on the
Firefox patches for 3.1.

Happy New Year!
