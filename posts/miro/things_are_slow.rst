Things have been slow for the last week and will probably remain slow
for the next week, too, mostly due to real life sorts of things among
the various developers. We took advantage of this slow period (it
doesn't happen often) to switch Miro development from svn to git. This
is something we've wanted to do for a while and should make the
development process we have a lot easier to deal with.

To summarize, things are slow right now, but they'll definitely pick up
again in September.
