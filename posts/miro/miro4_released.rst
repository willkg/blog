I tagged Miro v4.0 yesterday and did the final set of builds for
source, Windows and OSX.  It was a pretty monumental moment for me.

I think we started working on 4.0 back in October, though it might
have been earlier.  The feature set for 4.0 was really aggressive and
we added a few new people to the Miro dev team.  Also, I became a 
new dad in November.

The dev cycle was intense all the way through.  I was pretty much
working all available hours for the last few months or so including
nights and weekends.

Now Miro 4 is released.  Also, my baby is 6 months old.  It's arguable
which of these two monumentally life-changing events took more time,
energy and patience.  I honestly feel like a father of both projects.

In my queue of things left to do:

1. finish updating the `Miro user manual <http://manual.getmiro.com/>`_
2. create builds for Ubuntu Lucid, Maverick, and Natty

I'll be working on those over the next few days.

We've already started working on a Miro 4.0.1 to address issues with
4.0 that were either impossible for us to get good data on or were things
we had to defer in order to hit the May 23rd release date.  I think
the plan is to push 4.0.1 in a couple of weeks.

If you have problems, either `write up a bug report 
<http://bugzilla.pculture.org>`_ or send me an email 
(willkg at bluesock dot org) with the specifics of your problem.  I'll
try to respond in a day or two.
