Miro is nearing a 2.5 release candidate. There are only a couple of
things we're waiting on now like a VLC 1.0 release. I'm hoping for a
release candidate as late as next week and a final a week or two after
that depending on how well the release candidate works for people.

If you're a Miro translator, the strings are frozen and we sure could
use your help getting up-to-date accurate translations for Miro 2.5. If
you know someone who's done Miro translations in the past, let them know
that we're rapidly approaching the 2.5 release.

As a reminder, Miro 2.5 is the "trunk series" on Launchpad. Don't
translate the Miro 2.0 series--changes there won't be carried over to
trunk unless you do it yourself. The Miro trunk series translations page
is
`here <https://translations.launchpad.net/democracy/trunk/+translations>`__.

Now for the gripe. In the last week, Launchpad did an update which
changes the translations pages and they no longer tell you the last
updated date for individual translations. That's a real drag. I used
that field to figure out whether or not to export translations from
Launchpad and import them into Miro and to watch translation activity.
Grumble grumble grumble.
