I live in Somerville, MA, USA and I'd like to organize a Miro hackfest
in or near Boston. Possible topics for that hackfest include:

* cleaning up and improving the gtkx11 platform interface,
  gstreamer/xine use, ...
* working on bitesized bugs and working on unittests
* hacking together an interface for
  `Elisa <http://elisa.fluendo.com/>`__ or
  `MythTV <http://www.mythtv.org/>`__
* testing out the `fledgling Mozilla embedded
  API <http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/?p=359>`__ with the gtkx11
  interface
* sorting out packaging issues
* other things?

I was thinking we'd do the hackfest sometime in June. Possibly as part
of `FUDCon10 <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon/FUDConF10>`__ or in
the vicinity.

If you're interested and/or have ideas, find me on IRC, email me,
comment below, or send me telepathic messages of hope.
