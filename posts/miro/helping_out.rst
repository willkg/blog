Several people have hopped on ``#miro`` and ``#miro-hackers`` and asked
how they can join the community and help out.

Here are a few URLs to pages that talk about how to help:

* `Help build the open video
  revolution <http://www.getmiro.com/code/>`__ Talks about why what
  we're doing is important.
* `Translating <http://www.getmiro.com/code/translate/>`__ If you can
  help translate, definitely look at this page which talks (briefly)
  about how to get involved in the translation effort.
* `Democracy
  Testers <https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/wiki/DemocracyTesters>`__
  (should be renamed to Miro Testers) This page talks about our testing
  efforts. Miro runs on a huge number of operating systems on a wide
  variety of hardware. There are many issues with specific video cards
  and specific combinations of libraries, operating systems, and
  hardware. Help us test Miro on as many combinations as we can.
* `Team Miro <http://www.getmiro.com/wiki/>`__ Team Miro is
  instrumental in helping the developers flesh out issues into problems
  that the developers can reproduce and then fix, fleshing out
  documentation, and making Miro easier to use and more user-friendly.
  Team Miro meets on Tuesdays.
* `Make Internet TV <http://makeinternettv.org/>`__ Miro is a video
  player, but it's not very interesting without content. MITV is a
  web-site that walks people through the hardware, software, and skills
  needed to create video content. If you have experience in these
  areas, share it with others and help to make the site better.
