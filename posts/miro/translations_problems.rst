Our current status for translations is pretty rough. We support a lot of
languages, but few of them are complete translations. See
`<https://translations.launchpad.net/democracy/trunk/+pots/democracyplayer/>`_.

If you look at that page, you'll notice most of the translations haven't
been updated and/or are missing strings. Of those translations, the only
ones that are complete are English (United Kingdom), Norwegian Nynorsk,
and Ukranian.

I think part of the problem is that we don't have a good way of telling
people that we need translation updates.

If you're set up to do translation work or know someone who is, please
take some time this weekend to update the translations for your
language. We're planning a Miro 1.2 release some time next week.
Hundreds of thousands of people world-wide will appreciate what you've
done.

Also, if there's something that I can do to help make updating
translations more timely, let me know.
