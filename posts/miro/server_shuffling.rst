We've had a few servers are a hosting facility in Marlboro, MA, USA for
a long time now. Over the last year, we've been moving applications,
sites, systems and all that from the servers in Marlboro to the Amazon
cloud system. We're in the process of moving the last set of things to
Amazon.

We're working on making the transition go smoothly, but there are a lot
of pieces and it's possible we'll miss something along the way. If you
notice PCF/Miro-related sites being down, let me know.
