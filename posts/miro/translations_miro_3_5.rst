We pushed out Miro 3.5 rc1 on Friday and in doing that, we've marked the
end of this development cycle. Strings at this point should be very
stable--what's there is what'll be there for the release.

Miro users need your help! According to Launchpad, as of this writing,
the following languages have complete translations:

* French
* Serbian
* Ukranian

The following languages are pretty close:

* Galician - 6 untranslated strings
* Spanish - 14 untranslated strings
* Swedish - 28 untranslated strings
* Malay - 29 untranslated strings
* Russian - 30 untranslated strings

All other languages have more than 30 untranslated strings.

Miro users need your help!

Please go to
https://translations.launchpad.net/democracy/trunk/+translations and
help us make Miro great for users who speak languages you know! We've
worked really hard on Miro over the last six months to fix bugs, add new
functionality, and take Miro to the next level. But this work won't make
a lick of difference if users can't use the application because it's in
a foreign language for them.

We're looking at doing a Miro 3.5 final release in the next few
weeks--somewhere around October 11th.

Miro users need **your** help!

Also, if you've spent time working on translations, let me know! We have
a hard time tracking who is doing translation work on Miro and we want
to make sure that you are appreciated and thanked. Either comment below
or send me an email.
