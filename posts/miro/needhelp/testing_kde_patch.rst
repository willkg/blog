About a week ago, Joe contributed a patch to disable the screensaver on
KDE when Miro is playing fullscreen. I don't run any systems with KDE on
them. I'd love to get some help testing this patch so that we can
include it in the next release of Miro.

The bug for this work is
`<http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3067>`__. The patch is at
`<http://bugzilla.pculture.org/attachment.cgi?id=1980>`__.

Let me know whether this patch works or doesn't work for you either in
the comments of this blog entry or in the comments of the bug.
