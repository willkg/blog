A few years ago, we switched from Trac to Bugzilla. After doing this, we
discovered there were some things we really missed about Trac. The first
was a unified timeline so that we could see what was going on in the bug
tracker. The second was a roadmap that showed us, for a given milestone,
where we were at.

I coded up both of these and over the years have made some adjustments.
I made the timeline script available a while back, but I don't think I
ever made the roadmap script available.

The repository with both of these is at
`<https://git.participatoryculture.org/bugzillascripts/>`__.

They work with our Bugzilla 3.6 instance. I haven't tested either on
other versions or other instances.

If you use either or both, send me an email about whether it works for
you, bugs, comments, ...
