I uploaded a new .pot to Launchpad just now (first time for me!).

If you're a translator for the Miro application, please take a look at
the languages you translate for and update them accordingly.

We're planning to do a Miro 1.2.3 release in a week or so. The changes
since Miro 1.2 are minimal, so this allows existing translations to
improve for the 1.2.3 release.
