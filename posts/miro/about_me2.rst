I'm a Miro developer employed by `Participatory Culture
Foundation <http://pculture.org/>`__. I wrote a post `about
me </~willkg/blog/miro/about_me.html>`__ back in September of 2007 which
covered a bit of what I do. A lot has changed since then as my role on
the project has increased in scope and I've moved and various other
things like that. This is an update.

**What I do:**

I'm involved in project management, release planning, release
engineering, maintaining development infrastructure (bugzilla, git, wiki
pages, documentation, build scripts, nightly builds, bogon deflector,
syncing translations with Launchpad, ...), Ubuntu packaging, some
testing, bug triage, user support, and I'm a liason between the Miro
project and packagers and related projects.

I also do a lot of Miro development primarily on the Windows and Linux
platforms. I keep track of bugs in Debian and Fedora and fix them
upstream. I handle most of the incoming patches from contributors and
try to help contributors where I can to make their lives easier.

I spend a ton of time on Miro work--probably between 60 and 80 hours a
week.

**How does telecommuting work:**

I telecommute which makes it easier to work on Miro whenever I have a
free moment (blessing and a curse). I work with the other Miro people
through email, IRC, Bugzilla comments and weekly conference calls. We're
all pretty autonomous and it works pretty well. I imagine this is in
large part because we're such a small team. If the team grew, we'd have
to adjust the way we do things accordingly.

**Development setup:**

I bought a Del 1420N with Ubuntu on it a couple of years ago and do all
my development on that. I'm running a pretty stock Ubuntu Karmic with a
bunch of virtual machines in Virtual Box to cover different versions of
Ubuntu and Windows and also other Linux distributions. This is my
primary development machine. It's yellow.

I also have:

* a Macbook running OSX 10.4 for nightly and release builds (work
  machine)
* an old Dell something running Windows XP for nightly and release
  builds (work machine)
* a Mac Mini running OSX 10.5 for OSX development (work machine)
* a Dell XPS M1210 laptop (terrible machine) for Windows testing (work
  machine)
* an AMD64 box I built for AMD64 builds and testing
* an ASUS EeePC 701 running Ubuntu Karmic UNR for testing on a netbook
* a circa 2002 Gateway laptop running Debian Testing for testing
* a Neuros Link (graciously donated by `Neuros
  Technology <http://www.neurostechnology.com/>`__) for testing

I'd really like to get a bigger monitor. The 1440x900 display I have now
is small and cramped most of the time. I also need to build a better
desk.

**Ways you can get a hold of me:**

| irc: willkg on ``#miro-hackers`` on ``irc.freenode.net``
| email: ``will dot guaraldi at pculture dot org``

**Meet me for coffee:**

I live in Massachusetts about 30-45 minutes from Boston. If you're in the area,
I'd love to hang out for coffee. I head into Boston periodically for
conferences and hanging out with family and friends. I'm definitely interested
in hackfests or talking shop.

**The rest of my world:**

My web-site is at
`http://bluesock.org/~willg/ <http://bluesock.org/~willkg/>`__. I curate
`Python Miro Community <http://python.mirocommunity.org/>`__ and `Gnome
Miro Community <http://gnome.mirocommunity.org/>`__. I maintain
`PyBlosxom <http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/>`__. I'm a member of the
`Free Software Foundation <http://fsf.org/>`__. I'm a lover, not a
hater.
