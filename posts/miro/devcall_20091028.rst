**minutes**

Paul:

* Worked on Miro Community stuff over the week.
* Talked about infrastructure for the MC services.

Janet:

* 2.5.3 looks like a pretty good release.
* Tested Will's torrent-related fixes--looks good.
* Testing Luc's subtitle work. Found some bugs with the subtitle code
  and older versions of OSX. Otherwise, it's looking good so far.
* Talked a bit about Miro Community testing. We have a few volunteers
  helping, but there's still work to do.

Luc:

* Worked on subtitle stuff. Happy to see people are starting to test
  subtitle-enabled builds.
* Worked out some bugs so it now works on 10.4, 10.5, and 10.6.
* Working on getting subtitles working on Miro on Windows with VLC.
* This is coming along nicely and we decided it should land in Miro 2.6
  so we're going to move the work to the master branch.

Will:

* Reworked Miro on Windows to use a packaged binary kit.
* Switched Miro on Windows to use a pre-built libtorrent from the
  binary kit.
* Planning to do the same for Miro on OSX.
* Pushed out a set of Karmic packages for 2.5.3, but they aren't well
  tested.

* Did some bug-fixing.
