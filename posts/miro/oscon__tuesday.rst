I went to the convention center to check in today and run some errands.
I have an Expo pass, so I'm not able to go to the tutorials, sessions,
keynotes or some of the other things that were happening Monday and
Tuesday. Even so, there seems to be plenty to do.

Amongst other things, I talked to someone about his Eee PC, I did some
Miro hacking, I drew a Charlie Brown stripe on my laptop cover (it came
out awesome!), I talked to iSneeze on IRC about plugins (I need to write
up a post about plugins), and I discovered that there are 5 Starbucks
locations on the 8-block walk from the convention center to one of the
nearby Kinkos locations.

I was going to help Jay with the Mozilla booth setup, but they finished
before I got in contact with them. Instead, I went to the `FSF Portland
Pizza
Party <http://www.fsf.org/associate/events/2008/portland-pizza/>`__
which was really great. I talked with `Mako <http://mako.cc/>`__ and
`Asheesh <http://www.asheesh.org/>`__ both of whom I've known for many
years from `PyBlosxom <http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net>`__. I also met
Karen and Aaron from the `SFLC <http://www.softwarefreedom.org/>`__ and
Deborah and Joshua from the `FSF <http://www.fsf.org/>`__. I also met
`Gerv <http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/>`__ from
`Mozilla <http://mozilla.org>`__, too. And John Eckerman and a man named
Charlie and a man whose name I think was Craig.

Everyone I talked to fell into one of two groups:

#. Either hadn't heard of Miro or had, but didn't use it
#. Avid user of Miro

I didn't meet anyone who had heard of Miro and didn't like it. It sounds
like people are happy with Miro and look forward to the future of
Internet video with open standards without gatekeepers that we envision.
Also, several people mentioned that the content on the Channel Guide
just keeps getting better.

While at the FSF pizza party, I became an `associate
member <http://www.fsf.org/associate/>`__. The work that they're doing
is really beneficial to us all. They're pushing for open media standards
adoption, pushing for fixing the patent system in regards to software,
fighting against DRM, and a variety of other causes. It's important work
that needs to be done for video on the Internet to be open to everyone.

I'll be spending the next two days in the Mozilla booth. If you're at
OSCON, drop by and say hi!
