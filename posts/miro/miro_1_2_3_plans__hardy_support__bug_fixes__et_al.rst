I'm hoping to do a Miro 1.2.3 release in the next 7 days or so. This
release will include support for xulrunner 1.9 on gtkx11, support for
Ubuntu Hardy, updated translations, vlc 0.8.6f, and a bunch of bug fixes
for bugs found in Miro 1.2.2 and previous releases including some more
"Miro crashes on startup" type issues.

There are three things you can do to help:

#. help with translating Miro into languages you know -- see
   https://translations.launchpad.net/democracy/trunk/+pots/democracyplayer
#. testing Hardy packages -- see http://getmiro.com/download/ubuntu.php
   for the repository
#. send encouraging words and positive energy

Also, we'll definitely need help testing the Miro 1.2.3 rc0 build which
will be out in a few days--hopefully before Thursday.

I'll be on ``#miro-hackers`` on ``irc.freenode.net``. Also, if you have
problems, submit a bug report at
`bugzilla.pculture.org <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/>`__ or find
someone to do it for you on ``#miro`` or the forums.
