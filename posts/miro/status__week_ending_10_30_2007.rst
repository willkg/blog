This week I spent time on:

* gutsy-related issues
* gutsy packaging issues
* dbus-python deprecation warning (6226)
* sun-java*-plugin problems with Miro and gtkmozembed (8444)
* problems with mismatched gtkmozembed between compiling and linking
* tagging and releasing rc1 and rc2
* triaging all bugs assigned to me

Also, Dean and I went to PodCamp Boston 2 this weekend. Talking to
people about Miro resulted in one of three possibilities:

#. the person was really psyched about Miro, uses it
   frequently/all-the-time and had some questions about future
   development
#. the person thought Miro was neat, but either hadn't used it or
   thought it was still called Democracy Player
#. the person was wholly uninterested in Miro and didn't really see the
   point of having another media player in the space alongside players
   like FireAnt and Joost

The first group was really exciting to talk to. Dean and I tried to hook
this group into Team Miro and other Miro-related activities. Mostly I
just basked in the warm glow of a happy user--things have been cold and
miserable recently.

The second group was interesting and most people in this group asked the
important questions. I think connecting with this group was the most
important thing I did over the weekend.

The third group wasn't really all that exciting to talk to. Their
priorities don't match ours and I suspect most of them just feel hassled
by the fact that there's another media player to think about.

I also spent time listening to what terms people used for "video media
feeds". I heard "vidcast", "video cast", and "video podcast" most often,
I think. Just some more data in the "what the hell should we call this
thing"? bucket.

After 0.9.9.9-rc2 and 0.9.9.9 final, I'm going to be spending all my
time on mediabar and the Firefox extension. If I don't do that, I'm not
going to meet the deadlines.
