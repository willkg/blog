When you Adopt-a-Line at the `Miro Adoption
Center <http://getmiro.com/adopt/>`__, you're contributing to the
continued development and maintenance of Miro and the MiroGuide in
addition to helping us work on our mission to ensure that video is
healthy and accessible to everyone and that Open Video flourishes. This
is something that's really important to me and I can't thank people
enough for their contributions that enable me to do the work that I'm
doing.

We're getting really close to a Miro 2.5 release. If you adopt a line
before Monday, July 20th, then we'll make sure your name shows up in the
"About Miro" credits for Miro 2.5. If you adopt after that, we'll make
sure your name shows up in the next version, but that'll be a few months
down the road.

If contributing is as important to you as it is to me, take the time now
to adopt! It only took me a few minutes, and I've got a cute baby Zowwee
Kahn-Greene!
