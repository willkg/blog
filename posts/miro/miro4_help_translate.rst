The good news is that we've done a really great job with overhauling the ui.

The bad news is that it's taking a long time, we didn't really get a
good strings freeze, and thus translations of the strings in the
interface are in bad shape.

German has 2 untranslated strings.  Galician has 64.  The rest are over
150.  There are around 900 strings in Miro total.

I talked with Nick about this because we're planning to ship Miro 4.0 in
a week and that's probably not enough time to make the translations
better especially since the only way I have of contacting people who are
interested in doing the work is the equivalent of shouting at the top of
my lungs into the darkness.

So the plan is this:

1. I'm going to send this email and blog it and ask you to do whatever 
   you can to help us fix this: help translate, blog about the 
   situation, ...

2. We're going to ship Miro 4.0 with mediocre translations.

3. Any languages that have more than 450 untranslated strings will be
   removed from the release with the thinking that if there are that
   many untranslated strings, the interface is essentially unusable.

4. We're going to do a 4.0.1 release before June 6th.  I hope that
   people use Miro 4.0, realize the translations are in bad shape, and
   do something about it.

5. I'll keep an eye on the translation status and continue to do
   releases with updated translations when appropriate for the next 
   few months.

We currently use Launchpad for translations:

If you do help translate, please send me an email.  I want to include
you in the credits!
