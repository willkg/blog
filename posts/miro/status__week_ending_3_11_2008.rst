This week I fixed some bugs, worked on some bugs that I didn't get
anywhere with, and finally tagged and released Miro 1.2 rc0.

I also did some work with getting Miro on Gutsy to compile against
xulrunner 1.9 in the backports repository. I was basing the work on the
set of packages the Ubuntu people maintain. There are some changes in
there I don't understand the relevance of and their changelog isn't very
helpful. I pinged Fabien, but haven't heard anything back from him.

As a side note, and I can't imagine I'm alone in this feeling, Windows
bugs really suck and take gobs and gobs of time to work through.
