We've been working hard on Miro 4 for a while now. It's a very ambitious
development cycle: we're implementing a lot of new features, we're
fixing a lot of problems, we're improving performance, and we're fixing
codebase and infrastructure issues. We've done a ton of work.

On Saturday, I put out a set of Miro 4.0 beta1 builds. We've switched
into the release cycle for Miro 4.0. We're hoping to do a final release
by the end of the month.

At this point, I don't think anyone's written much about Miro 4 or shown
any screenshots of what it looks like right now. So here's some for your
ogling:

   Figure 1: The new standard view.

You can also see changes in the sidebar on the left side, and filters on the
top. You can also see in the sidebar the new Stores section which makes it
easier to buy content from Amazon and other stores and pull it into Miro
automatically.

   Figure 2: The new list view.

List view has an item details pane on the bottom so you can see the details of
the item. If the selected item was a music item with cover art, the cover art
would show up in the item details pane.

   Figure 3: The new connect tab.

This is where you configure DAAP-based sharing allowing you to stream media
from Miro to other DAAP-supporting systems on your network. You can also sync
with Android devices as well as any mass storage device (thumbdrive, external
hard drive, ...).

There's a lot more, but I'm going to keep this short.

Builds are located on the `nightlies
page <http://nightlies.pculture.org/>`__ in the Sticky Files section.

Note that this is a beta release! There are still some problems and
tweaks we're working on.

We could use any help we can get `translating
strings <https://translations.launchpad.net/democracy>`__ and `testing
builds <http://pculture.org/devblogs/mirotesting/>`__.

Also, if you help with testing and translation, please let me know so I
can gleefully add you to the credits where you rightfully belong!

w00t for beta releases and w00t for almost there!
