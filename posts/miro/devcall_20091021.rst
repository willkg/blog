**minutes**

Nick and Luc weren't on the call. Janet and Will had colds. Ben's side
of the call had some weird 15 second delay. That made it a dicey call
that we ended on IRC.

Minutes for this morning's call:

Paul:

* Working on Miro Community finishing up version 0.8.

Ben:

* Worked on a lot of bugs, especially 12101. Checked in a few fixes
  into master which look pretty good, but need testing.
* Worked on a bunch of other bugs.
* Worked on 12229 to allow for distribution of RSS and content on a
  DVD.

Will:

* Worked on extracting binary kit stuff from the repository.
* Planning to work on Karmic packages for 2.5.3.

Janet:

* Sick.
* Hoping to get to testing the changes Ben made for 12101.
* Spent some time testing Miro Community and is getting geared up to
  start testing Luc's subtitle code.

**bugzilla**

* 14 bugs created
* 2 bugs marked FIXED
* 1 bug marked DUPLICATE
