On the dev conference call today we talked about how many things have
been fixed, changed, implemented, et al in the Miro 2.6 development
cycle. We decided this isn't a .1 improvement--it should get it's own
major version number.

As such, we're changing the version number for the next version of Miro
from 2.6 to 3.0.

The effects of this are pretty small--it's just a name change. However,
our Bugzilla Roadmap urls are specific to a version.

Instead of using:

http://bugzilla.pculture.org/roadmap.cgi?product=Miro&target=2.6

Use this:

http://bugzilla.pculture.org/roadmap.cgi?product=Miro&target=3.0
