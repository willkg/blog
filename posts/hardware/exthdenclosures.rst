I need an external HDD enclosure so that I can [fill in obvious use cases
here].  I have a couple of 3.5" drives that I'm not using, so that eliminates
a 2.5" enclosure that can power off USB which is a bit of a shame.

Anyhow, I was looking at these:

* `3.5 & 5.25 USB 2.0 External Drive Enclosure (ME-320U2) <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00029RDMW/qid=1109352081/sr=1-6/ref=sr_1_6/102-5513759-6776909?v=glance&s=electronics>`_
* `Sabrent 5.25" USB 2.0 Aluminum External Hard Drive Enclosure <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0007LBP5G/qid=1109352121/sr=1-20/ref=sr_1_20/102-5513759-6776909?v=glance&s=electronics>`_

* `Kingwin Silver 3.5" USB 2.0 Aluminum External Hard Drive Enclosure <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0007SMQM0/qid=1109352176/sr=1-32/ref=sr_1_32/102-5513759-6776909?v=glance&s=electronics>`_
* `PPA 3.5" USB 2.0/Firewire External Hard Drive Enclosure with Light Bar <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0007QQJ4I/qid=1109352212/sr=1-60/ref=sr_1_60/102-5513759-6776909?v=glance&s=electronics>`_

I haven't heard anything about any of these companies, though.  So that makes
it a bit difficult to decide which one to get.

Anyone have any thoughts?  Anyone have a HDD enclosure they prefer over these?
