I've been reading about them for about 6 months now and I've been tossing
around whether to get one or not since they started selling.  I have
a Sharp Zaurus 5600 which I never use and so I figured I'd pine over but
never actually buy a Nokia 770.

Then I had a change of heart.  I bought one because it's easy to use, 
small, has a full-blown Linux distribution that takes .deb packaged
files, has a great web-browser, is in constant development as an
Open Source project, and someone's gone and ported Python to it.

I ordered it on Sunday and it showed up on Wednesday.  I've been getting
to know it for a little under a day now and I'm really impressed--it
both fits my needs and extends my ability to do things very nicely.  I'm
planning to bring it travelling next week with a load of PDFs on it of
things I want to read.  Additionally, I've been able to check email which
helped me get to a meeting yesterday night after I had forgotten the
location.

w00t!
