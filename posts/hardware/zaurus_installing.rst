I have a Sharp Zaurus 5600 that I bought when Amazon.com had them for
like $260 (might have been $280).  It was a price at which I decided
it was definitely worth getting a handheld computer with a thumboard
that was running Linux.

Anyhow, so I ended up with a minor issue...  The Zaurus 5600 I got
had a PXA 250 Intel chip which has some problem with caching or something
like that.  The PXA 255 chip fixes this problem.  In order for Linux
to work on the device, they slowed down the something or other.  So I
think the end result is that the 5600 with the PXA 250 is slower than
the 5600 with the PXA 255.  I'm really fuzzy on all of that mostly
because I don't really care a whole lot.

The OE team put out the 3.5.1 OZ release a couple of weeks ago.  I
followed the instructions 
`here in the OZ install guide <http://openembedded.org/oe_wiki/index.php/OpenZaurusPoodleInstallGuide>`_
and downloaded the files from 
`here <http://openzaurus.org/official/unstable/3.5.1/sl5600/>`_.

Everything seems to be working on the pda itself.  OPIE is pretty neat--I'm
definitely very excited.  The ability to rotate the screen is **awesome**.
It's definitely a lot more snappy than the Sharp ROM that comes with the
Zaurus 5600 itself.

Next step is to get a wireless card.  After that, I want to install some
games for those dull moments in life.
