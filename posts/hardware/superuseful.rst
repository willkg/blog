Carrying a Nokia 770 through airport hoo-ha is much easier than
carrying a laptop, so that was really nice.  I packed a series
of pdfs onto it
(`Programming LanguageS: Application and Interpretation
<http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Books/ProgLangs/>`_,
`Free Culture <http://www.free-culture.cc/>`_,
`Open Source Development with CVS <http://cvsbook.red-bean.com/>`_,
...)
and read through a good portion of only one of them.

Also, the Nokia 770 comes with two stylii (not sure why), which allowed
S and I to play Mahjong together.  That was a little comical since there
were two of us huddled over this little tiny screen.  Still, it was
really fun.

I also had WIFI and web-browsing capabilities everywhere I was which
was really nice.

Batteries held out pretty well.  I went two or three days of medium
usage with the light set to low and the WIFI off without any problem.
I brought the charger which is pleasantly small and charged the battery
at the airport before the return flight home.

It's been helpful at school, too, since I can check my gmail account 
wherever I am on campus.

I read `A 770 is ultra-small and mobile, but not a UMPC <http://www.internettablettalk.com/blog/?p=248>`_
`Internet Tablet Users Blog <http://www.internettablettalk.com/blog/>`_
and they mention a series of issues people are having...  but I'm not
having any of them.  My browser has never crapped out, the device has never
hung, I'm not having problems loading any web-sites that I look at 
(though I don't look at Palm Addict), no problems with memory or speed
of the device, ...

I have to admit when I first saw the Origami marketing, I wondered for
a bit about whether I should have waited and bought a UMPC, but...  the
Nokie 770 runs on free software and I can write programs that run on it
without having to purchase Microsoft software licenses and that's a big 
plus for me.

Additionally, I think I'll look for a digital camera that takes the same
kind of MMC card my Nokia takes when I'm in the market for a new digital
camera.  That'd be really neat: take a picture, put the card in my
Nokia, email it to people I know--all with devices I put in my
pocketses.

Anyhow, happy so far.  The only minor issue is that the text for books
is so small that it's hard to read if I'm in an airplane going through
turbulence.
