I upgraded my Nokia 770 to Internet Tablet OS 2006 and it's fantastic.
It's faster, more responsive, and more stable.  Additionally, there's
an application manager that downloads from a repository just like
Debian which is _hugely_ awesome.  The browser is faster, too.

My only issue so far is that I haven't quite got the knack of launching 
the thumbboard.  At some point, I'll look into that.
