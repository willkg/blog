The OpenEmbedded/OpenZaurus folks released 3.5.2 today.  I flashed with the 
new image and it's pretty cool, though I don't notice any differences.  
Mostly I just flashed and pressed a bunch of buttons and then shut it off.

I need to get a case before I really want to bring it around with me.
I'm still paranoid that I'm going to break it while using it.
I need to get a wireless card or figure out how to sync with the docking
station or something similar so I can back up my information.
