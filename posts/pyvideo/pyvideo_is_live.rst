What is Python Miro Community
=============================

`Python Miro Community <http://python.mirocommunity.org>`_ is an index
of Python-related videos on the Internet.  For the most part, it's a
collection of videos from Python-related conferences.  Saw a session you
liked and want to share it?  It's likely you can find it and share it
with Python Miro Community.


pyvideo.org is live!
====================

About three weeks ago, I decided I really needed a bunch of things that
Miro Community didn't have and it was really hampering my ability to do
what I wanted to do with the site and also interoperate with Carl and
Ryan's system. It was time to write my own software and host my own site.

The software is called `richard <http://github.com/willkg/richard>`_.
It's released under the AGPLv3, is currently hosted on Github, and it's
in a ridiculously alpha state. richard is at its heart a video indexing
site. I'm working on it in my "copious spare time" and hit a critial
mass last night---enough to launch `pyvideo.org <http://pyvideo.org/>`_.

I'm pulling in `PyCon US 2012 <https://us.pycon.org/2012/>`_ videos
as they're coming in right now.

Oh, wait... that means I should have started this blog post differently....
