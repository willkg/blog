What is pyvideo.org
===================

`pyvideo.org <http://pyvideo.org/>`_ is an index of Python-related
videos on the Internet. For the most part, it's a collection of
videos from Python-related conferences. Saw a session you liked and
want to share it? It's likely you can find it, watch it, and share
it with pyvideo.org.

I posted the `videos for EuroPython 2012 <http://pyvideo.org/category/21/europython-2012>`_
last night. Many thanks to Omar who pulled together metadata for the
conference.

If you look at the videos on the site, the data is kind of a mess. I spent
a bunch of time reconciling issues with the data from the YouTube feed with
data from the EuroPython 2012 site and fixed a lot of issues, but there's
still a lot left to do.

I spent about 10 hours working on the data for EuroPython 2012.

My current plan is to leave it like this for now and forge ahead to catch
up with other conferences from 2012. Then I'll go back and continue working
on a system for crowd-sourcing metadata fixes. That will make it easier for
anyone to fix data they see is wrong and also remove me as a bottleneck
to a better index of Python video.

I'm working on SciPy 2012, PyCon AU 2012, and PyCon DE 2011. You can see
the `queue of conferences here <http://pyvideo.org/suggestions/videos>`_.
