What is pyvideo.org
===================

`pyvideo.org <http://pyvideo.org/>`_ is an index of Python-related
conference and user-group videos on the Internet. Saw a session you
liked and want to share it? It's likely you can find it, watch it,
and share it with pyvideo.org.

I fixed a few issues and finally (`finally`) pushed out major site
updates. Some of them are implemented in the worst possible way
(e.g. facet filters for the search page), but some of them are great
(e.g. Amara subtitle support).

I'm still struggling with a lot of technical debt on the site and a
lack of time to really focus on it. That's mostly what's been making
fixing the issues, improving the site and adding conferences take so
long.

Sheila and I will be at `PyCon US <https://us.pycon.org/2014/>`_ and
hanging around for sprint days. If anyone is interested in sprinting,
we'll be there. Even if we don't get any coding done, figuring out how
to solve some of the bigger problems and planning what should be done
in the next year would be a huge accomplishment.

If you're at PyCon and see either of us, feel free to give us a piece
of your mind in regards to how you use PyVideo and what could be
better.
