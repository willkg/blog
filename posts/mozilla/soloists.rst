Building Firefox is a big endeavor. There are many teams and projects covering
initiatives, maintenance, bug fixing, triage, localization, support,
understanding feedback, marketing, communication, releasing, supporting
infrastructure, crash analysis, and a bazillion other activities all to build a
family of browsers and applications.

Teams and projects aren't static. People move around as priorities change and
the landscape shifts and projects complete or are scuttled.

Sometimes projects get started up with a single person. Sometimes all the people
except one move off a project. Sometimes we find ourselves working alone, in a
basement office, with only a stapler equivalent to keep us company.

We are the soloists. You wouldn't believe the list of things we work on. Alone.


Where to find soloists: IRC, Slack
==================================

There's an IRC channel ``#soloists`` on ``irc.mozilla.org``.

There's also a Slack channel ``#soloists`` on the Mozilla Slack [1]_.

These two places (and whatever other places soloists want to hang out at) are
places where we can:

* find some solace from the weary drudgery of being alone on their projects for
  days on end
* ask for help
* bounce ideas off each other
* vent frustrations in a friendly forgiving place
* get advice on dealing with things like code reviews and how to go on vacation
* get recognition for a job well done

and a variety of other things that alleviate many of the problems we have as
soloists.

.. [1] I just created it, so it's kind of empty. I'm feeling alone in the
   ``#soloists`` Slack channel. So alone.


Stickers at the All Hands!
==========================

Over the last month or so, we spent some time figuring out ``#soloists``
stickers because we like stickers and you like stickers and everyone likes
stickers.

They look like this:

   Soloist 2017 sticker.


They're 2" by 2" and round. They're warm to the touch. They make you want to
climb things. By yourself. Alone. With appropriate safety gear. [2]_

**If you're a soloist**, come find one of us and get a sticker. Also, consider
joining soloist channels.

**If you support soloists**, come find one of us and get a sticker. Ask us about
the things we're working on. We may be solo, but we're working on real projects
that almost certainly affect you. As a group, we did great things in the last 6
months. Alone. So alone.

.. [2] That's how they make me feel, anyhow.
