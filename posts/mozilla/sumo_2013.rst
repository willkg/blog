It was a big year for `SUMO <https://support.mozilla.org/>`_. In 2012,
we got a lot accomplished: new search, new information architecture,


One thing I didn't do was make my year-end script product better
output.

Anyhow---on with stats!

1. Ricky does a lot of work! Holy cow!

2. In 2011, we had 19 people who contributed code changes.

   In 2012, we had 23 people.

   In 2013, we had 32 people.

3. Like 2011 and 2012, we resolved more bugs than we created
   in 2013. That's three years in a row! I've never seen that happen
   on a project I work on.

4. There are a lot of people braving Bugzilla to write up bugs. 
   Skimming the list, I see developers, non-developers, Support
   contributors, localizers, support team and a lot of people I
   don't recognize.


Here's some number comparisons:

==========================  ====  ====  ====

I spent a good chunk of 2013 working on Input, but here's what I remember
from SUMO development in 2013:

1. We rearranged the codebase for better Django 1.4 layout. That was a
   project. Oy.

2. We added support for non-English languages to the support forums!

3. We switched email to be HTML formatted. We also reworked email to be
   localized.

4. We switched to Google Analytics.

5. We implemented Open Badges---though there's still a few important
   pieces to finish there.

6. We switched to YouTube for videos.

7. We added support for Webmaker and Firefox OS. Thunderbird support
   will be added to SUMO in 2014.

8. Mike took a lantern, a crust of bread and a big sword and spelunked
   into the darkest dungeons filled with stinky, squelchy muck and
   rewrote the showfor code.

9. We reworked our search code to handle multiple indexes, though we
   haven't taken advantage of that, yet.

10. We switched deployment to use `Dennis <https://github.com/willkg/dennis/>`_  to
    lint all translated strings before pushing them to
    production. This has almost assuredly saved us from production
    fires. I hated those kinds of fires. Hooray for Dennis!

11. We wrote and switched to `Ernest <https://github.com/willkg/ernest/>`_ for
    sprint planning and coordination.

12. We overhauled everything to add support for Persona
    authentication, but had to push off deployment indefinitely
    because of problems with Persona which are being ironed out by the
    Persona team.

13. We added an escalation system for questions that haven't received
    a response in x hours for some positive value of x that is still
    in flux.

14. We ditched Highcharts.

15. We wrote a command-line deployer which tells us exactly what's going
    out and tells New Relic, too. This gives us a much better idea of what
    we're deploying and how it affected the site afterwards. This command-line
    deployer is named `chief-james <https://github.com/mythmon/chief-james>`_
    in honor of James who has moved on to greener and well measured pastures.

16. We added a bunch of new metrics, dashboards, history pages,
    activity pages, icons, bicons, landing pages, take-off pages,
    topics, subtopics, toe picks and all kinds of stuff.


That's the gist of the year: it was a lot of work, but we accomplished a
ton.

w00t for 2013!
