What is it?
===========

The purpose of `Input <https://input.mozilla.org/>`_ is to collect
actionable feedback from our user base across each channel of our
software development process. The application collects feedback and
offers a set of analysis methods for looking at the resulting data. 

`Project site <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Input>`_.

This is my 2014 retrospective for Input.

.. TEASER_END


2014 was a big year for Input. This is
the year we hit a point where the project is mature and stable. This
is the year we worked on making it easier for new people to start
working on Input. This is the year we fixed all the issues that made
it difficult for Input to support multiple products. This is the year
we created an API that allowed anyone to access the data to let them
write their own dashboards. This is the year we implemented a
translation infrastructure so that non-English feedback can flow
through our tools (previously, it was handled manually). It was
a big year.


Bugzilla and git stats

Some observations:

1. In 2013, we resolved more bugs than we created partially because we
   closed a bunch of bugs related to the old Input that weren't
   relevant anymore.

   In 2014, we created more bugs than we closed by 10%. I think that's
   about what we want.

2. 15 people had git commits. 26 people created bugs. 14 people
   resolved bugs. 65 people commented on bugs.

   One thing I don't have is counts for who helped translate strings
   which is a really important part of development. My apologies.

3. Of all those people, only 1 is a "core developer"--that's
   me. Everyone else contributed their time and energies towards
   making Input better. I really appreciate that. Thank you!


That's the stats!


Accomplishments
===============

Things we did in 2014:

**Site health dashboard**: I wrote a site health dashboard that helps
me understand how the site is performing before and after deployments
as well as after releases and other events.

**Client side smoke tests**: I wrote smoke tests for the client
side. I based it on the defunct input-tests code that QA was
maintaining up until we rewrote Input. The smoke tests have been
invaluable for reducing/eliminating data-loss bugs.

**Vagrant**: I took some inspiration from Erik Rose and DXR and wrote
a Vagrant provisioning shell script. This includes a docs overhaul as
well.

**Automated translation system (human and machine)**: I wrote an
automated translation system. It's generalized so that it isn't
model/field specific. It's also generalized so that we can add plugins
for other translation systems. It's currently got plugins for `Dennis
<https://dennis.readthedocs.org/>`_, Gengo machine translation and
Gengo human translation. We're machine translating most incoming
feedback.  We're human translating Firefox OS feedback. This was a
*HUGE* project, but it's been immensely valuable.

**Better query syntax**: We were upgraded to Elasticsearch 0.90.10. I
switched the query syntax for the dashboard search field to use
Elasticsearch ``simple_query_string``. That allows users to express
search queries they weren't previously able to express.

**utm_source and utm_campaign handling**: I finished the support for
handling ``utm_source`` and ``utm_campaign`` querystring
parameters. This allows us to differentiate between organic feedback
and non-organic feedback.

**More like this**: I added a "more like this" section to the response
view. This makes it possible for UA analyzers to look at a response
and see other responses that are similar.

**Dashboards for everyone**: We wrote an API and some compelling
examples of dashboards you can build using the API. It's being used in
a few places now. We'll grow it going forward as needs arise. I'm
pretty psyched about this since it makes it possible for people with
needs to help themselves and not have to wait for me to get around to
their work.

`Dashboards for everyone project plan
<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Input/Dashboards_for_Everyone>`_.

**Vagrant**: We took the work I did last quarter and improved upon it,
rewrote the docs and have a decent Vagrant setup now. L. Guruprasad
improved on this and the documentation and setting up a Vagrant-based
vm for Input development is much easier.

`Reduce contributor pain project plan
<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Input/Reduce_Contributor_Pain>`_.

**Abuse detection**: Ian spent his internship working on an abuse
classifier so that we can more proactively detect and prevent abusive
feedback from littering Input. We gathered some interesting data and
the next step is probably to change the approach we used and apply
some more complex ML things to the problem. The key here is that we
want to detect abuse with confidence and not accidentally catch swaths
of non-abuse. Input feedback has some peculiar properties that make
this difficult.

`Reduce the abuse project plan
<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Input/Reduce_the_Abuse>`_.

**Loop support**: Loop is now using Input for user sentiment feedback.

**Heartbeat support**: User Advocacy is working on a project to give
us a better baseline for user sentiment. This project was titled
Heartbeat, but I'm not sure whether that'll change or not. Regardless,
we added support for the initial prototype.

`Heartbeat v1 project plan
<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Input/Heartbeat>`_.

**Data retention policy**: We've been talking about a data retention
policy for some time. We decided on one, finalized it and codified it
in code.

**Shed the last vestiges of Playdoh and funfactory**: We shed the last
bits of Playdoh and funfactory. Input uses the same protections and
security decisions those two projects enforced, but without being tied
to some of the infrastructure decisions. This made it easier to
switch to peep-based requirements management.

**Switched to FactoryBoy and overhauled tests**: Tests run pretty fast
in Fjord now. We switched to FactoryBoy, so writing model-based tests
is a lot easier than the stuff we had before.

**Python 2.7**: Input is now running on Python 2.7. Thank you, Jake!

**Remote troubleshooting data capture**: The generic feedback form
which is hosted on Input now has a section allowing users to opt-in
to sending data about their browser along with their feedback. This
data is crucial to helping us suss out problems with video playback,
graphics cards/drivers and malicious addons.

This code is still "alpha". We'll be finishing it up in 2015q1.

`Remote troubleshooting data capture project plan
<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Input/Support_aboutsupport>`_.

**Heartbeat v1 and v2**: People leave feedback on Input primarily when
they're frustrated with something. Because of this, the sentiment
numbers we get on Input tilt heavily negative and only represent
people who are frustrated and were able to find the feedback
form. Heartbeat will give us sentiment data that's more representative
of our entire user base.

As a stop-gap to get the project going, Input is the backend
collecting all the Heartbeat data. We rewrote the Heartbeat-related
code for Heartbeat v2 in 2014q4.

`Heartbeat v2 project plan
<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Input/Heartbeat#v2:_beat_harder>`_.

**Feedback form overhaul**: We rewrote the feedback form to clean up
the text, reduce confusion about what data is made public and what
data is kept private, reduce the number of steps to leave feedback and
improve the form for both desktop and mobile devices.

We also fixed the form so it supports multiple products because we're
collecting feedback for multiple products on Input now.

Thoughts
========

Looking at the stats above, it's pretty clear that this is predominantly
a one-person project. Ricky, Mike and Rehan do all my code review. Without
them, things would be a lot worse.

Having said that, the "baby-factor" stinks on this project. That's
something I'm going to work on over 2015:

* improving the documentation and making sure all the important things
  are covered or easily figured out

* improving the project planning and making sure most/all project
  planning is done in public or at least has a publicly available
  record

* reducing the complexity of the application, reducing dependencies
  and making the parts less tangled

* reducing the number of things that make Input a "special snowflake"
  in regards to other sites my peers maintain

==============================

Input is a great little Django application that collects feedback for
Mozilla products. It's an important part of the Mozilla product
ecosystem. Working on it helps millions of people. If you're
interested in being a part of the team that develops it, here are
some helpful links:

* We maintain a `Get Involved page <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webdev/GetInvolved/input.mozilla.org>`_.
* We hang out on ``#input`` on irc.mozilla.org.
* We have an `input-dev mailing list <https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/input-dev>`_.

LGuruprasad found a bug in the script that caused commits-by-author
information to be wrong. Fixed the script and updated the stats!
