.. description: 10 years at Mozilla
.. type: text

It's been a long while since I wrote :doc:`year_in_review_2012`. I hit my
10-year "Moziversary" as an employee on September 6th. I was hired in a
"doubling" period of Mozilla, so there are a fair number of people who are
hitting 10 year anniversaries right now. It's interesting to see that even
though we're all at the same company, we had different journeys here.

I started out as a Software Engineer or something like that. Then I was
promoted to Senior Software Engineer and then Staff Software Engineer. Then
last week, I was promoted to Senior Staff Software Engineer. My role at work
over time has changed significantly. It was a weird path to get to where I am
now, but that's probably a topic for another post.

I've worked on dozens of projects in a variety of capacities. Here's a handful
of the ones that were interesting experiences in one way or another:

* `SUMO (support.mozilla.org) <https://support.mozilla.org/>`_: Mozilla's
  support site
* Input: Mozilla's feedback site, user sentiment analysis, and Mozilla's
  initial experiments with Heartbeat and experiments platforms
* `MDN Web Docs <https://developer.mozilla.org/>`_: documentation, tutorials,
  and such for web standards
* `Mozilla Location Service <https://location.services.mozilla.com/>`_:
  Mozilla's device location query system
* Buildhub and `Buildhub2 <https://buildhub.moz.tools/>`_: index for build
  information
* `Socorro <https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/>`_: Mozilla's crash ingestion
  pipeline for collecting, processing, and analyzing crash reports for Mozilla
  products
* `Tecken <https://symbols.mozilla.org/>`_: Mozilla's symbols server for
  uploading and downloading symbols and also symbolicating stacks
* `Standup <https://github.com/mozilla/standup>`_: system for reporting and
  viewing status
* FirefoxOS: Mozilla's mobile operating system

I also worked on a bunch of libraries and tools:

* `siggen <https://github.com/willkg/socorro-siggen>`_: library for
  generating crash signatures using the same algorithm that Socorro uses (Python)
* `Everett <https://github.com/willkg/everett>`_: configuration library (Python)
* `Markus <https://github.com/willkg/markus>`_: metrics client library (Python)
* `Bleach <https://github.com/mozilla/bleach>`_: sanitizer for user-provided
  text for use in an HTML context (Python)
* `ElasticUtils <https://github.com/mozilla/elasticutils>`_: Elasticsearch query
  DSL library (Python)
* `mozilla-django-oidc <https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-django-oidc>`_: OIDC
  authentication for Django (Python)
* `Puente <https://github.com/mozilla/puente>`_: convenience library for using
  gettext strings in Django (Python)
* `crashstats-tools <https://github.com/willkg/crashstats-tools>`_: command
  line tools for accessing Socorro APIs (Python)
* `rob-bugson <https://github.com/willkg/rob-bugson>`_: Firefox addon that adds
  Bugzilla links to GitHub PR pages (JS)
* `paul-mclendahand <https://github.com/willkg/paul-mclendahand>`_: tool for
  combining GitHub PRs into a single branch (Python)
* `Dennis <https://github.com/willkg/dennis>`_: gettext translated strings
  linter (Python)

I was a part of things:

* `Mozilla Webdev <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webdev>`_
* Soloists
* `Security Champion <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Champions>`_
* Data steward for crash data
* `Mozilla Open Source Support <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/>`_: I
  served on the Foundational Technology grant committee

I've given a few presentations [1]_:

* `Dennis Dubstep translation
  <https://blog.mozilla.org/webdev/2013/10/01/beer-and-tell-september-2013-edition/>`_
  (2013)
* `Tecken Overview
  <https://bluesock.org/~willkg/presentations/tecken_overview_2020/>`_ (2020)
* :doc:`Socorro Overview <socorro_overview_2021>` (2021)

I made some stickers:

I've worked with a lot of people and created some really warm, wonderful
friendships. Some have left Mozilla, but we keep in touch.

I've been to many work weeks, conferences, summits, and all hands trips.

I've gone through a few profile pictures:

I've built a few desks, though my pictures are pretty meagre:

I've written lots of blog posts on status, project retrospectives, releases,
initiatives, and such. Some of them are fun reads still.

It's been a long 10 years. I wonder if I'll be here for 10 more. It's possible!
