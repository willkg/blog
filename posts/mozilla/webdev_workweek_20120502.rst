I'm at the webdev work week in Santa Cruz, CA, USA this week. It's great to
meet people I've been talking to for the last 6 months. It's also kind of
nice to take a break from the SUMO sprints. I've been spending the time
lifting my head and seeing what's been happening while I wasn't paying
attention.

List of three things on my mind:

1. I wish I had more time. There are so many people doing exciting things
   that I'd love to work on, too, but I just don't have enough time. It's
   hard to suppress the, "Wow---that looks awesome! I'll help you on that
   project!" reflex. I just don't have time. It's kind of a bummer. On
   the flip side, if I do discover myself with free time, I have a long
   (long) list of things I'm interested in.

2. It's nice to talk about technical things. It's nice to make a (bad)
   joke about mime types and get a response. (An HTTP response! ha ha!)

3. Everyone is really super and friendly. I don't think I've been in a
   group this big that's lacking a token jerk. This has caused me to idly
   wonder if maybe I'm the token jerk. If so, I hope someone leaves me a
   note so I can adjust accordingly.

Things I'm taking away (so far):

1. I should dig up my compilers book and re-read it because I really liked
   studying compilers way back when.

2. I screwed up with spreading Elasticsearch knowledge. I keep having
   conversations about problems we've seen and solved in SUMO that other
   projects are having. Plus it seems like everyone has their own branch
   of ElasticUtils with differing features.  I'm going to try to spend some
   time working on making the situation better both by documenting things
   and also improving ElasticUtils so we're not all maintaining our own
   versions.

3. Need to spend more time learning things.
