`PyOhio 2011 <http://pyohio.org/>`_ happened last weekend.  I'm
currently working with Carl at `Next Day Video <http://www.nextdayvideo.com/>`_
to get the videos they're posting to the blip.tv feed into 
`Python Miro Community <http://python.mirocommunity.org/>`_.

I'm using a similar process to what we used with PyCon 2011 videos, but
we don't have to figure it out on the fly this time around, so things
are going much smoother.

As of now, there are three videos posted with more coming as they're
uploaded and work their way through the workflow.

* `Data-Transfer Objects are a Disease.  Meet the cure.
  <http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/4373/pyohio-2011-data-transfer-obje>`_
* `Using Fabric - from a sysadmin's perspective
  <http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/4372/pyohio-2011-using-fabric-from->`_
* `Aspen: A Next-generation Web Framework
  <http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/4371/pyohio-2011-aspen-a-next-gener>`_

If you have some spare time, please consider helping out with subtitling
the videos.  Whenever a video is subtitled, it becomes accessible to a
much wider audience.  If you help out with subtitling, please let me
know so that I can thank you.
