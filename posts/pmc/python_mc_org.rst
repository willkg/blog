Today I'm releasing `Python Miro
Community <http://python.mirocommunity.org/>`__. This site is a `Miro
Community <http://mirocommunity.org/>`__ focused on
`Python <http://python.org/>`__. It brings together videos from Python
conferences, local user groups, screencasts, and tutorials.

I'm working on it in my spare time because:

#. I think it's really important to get this video out to a larger
   audience, and
#. it's really important to make it easier for users and developers to
   find video they're looking for.

This site helps on both fronts. The first in that it collects video into
one place without re-hosting it. The second in that I'm curating the
site and through better descriptions and tags, the video becomes more
findable.

It's not finished--it's an ongoing project that I'll continue to work
on. My ultimate goal is to connect with Python video producers like Carl
Karsten (whose work is phenomenal), conference A/V people, local user
group A/V people, and all those people out there making screencasts,
tutorials and project status videos to make sure Python Miro Community
stays relevant and continues to helps creators and consumers.

It's free. I'm doing this in my spare time, `Participatory Culture
Foundation <http://pculture.org/>`__ (the non-profit behind
`Miro <http://getmiro.com/>`__) is providing the server and resources to
host the site, and the video on the site is available for free on the
Internet.

Spend some time today to take a look at the site, browse the `PyCon
2009 <http://python.mirocommunity.org/listing/tag/pycon2009>`__ and
`DjangoCon
2009 <http://python.mirocommunity.org/listing/tag/djangocon2009/>`__
videos, spend some time honing your Python skills with either the
`Python
basics <http://python.mirocommunity.org/listing/tag/python-basics/>`__
or `Python
advanced <http://python.mirocommunity.org/listing/tag/python-advanced/>`__
tracks, follow along with the
`ChiPy <http://python.mirocommunity.org/listing/tag/chipy/>`__ or
`PyAtl <http://python.mirocommunity.org/listing/tag/pyatl/>`__ local
user groups, and see what's out there.

Love it? Hate it? Let me know in the comments.

Thank you to Carl Karsten and Steve Holden for their help pulling this
site together!
