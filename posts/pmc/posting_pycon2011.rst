The Ogg Theora versions of the `PyCon 2011 <http://us.pycon.org/>`__
videos are posted on `the PyCon blip.tv
channel <http://pycon.blip.tv/>`__ now and I'm slowly pulling them in to
`Python Miro Community <http://python.mirocommunity.org/>`__.

I'd do them all in one big batch, except that it takes a minute or two
to approve each video and also the Miro Community feeds are limited to
30 items, so if anyone is using a podcast client and watching the `PyCon
2011 feed <http://python.mirocommunity.org/feeds/category/pycon-2011>`__
they'd miss any that fell out of the 30 maximum. That's `bug
15177 <http://bugzilla.pculture.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15177>`__ and I'm
hoping to fix it soon.

PyCon 2011 had some really great sessions. If you haven't already seen
the ones you were interested in, I encourage you to keep an eye on the
`PyCon 2011
category <http://python.mirocommunity.org/category/pycon-2011>`__ as
videos get posted.

These videos are being posted with `Universal
Subtitles <http://universalsubtitles.org/>`__ support. If you presented
at PyCon 2011, please take the time to caption your video. Captioning
makes it easier to provide translated subtitles, makes it accessible to
people who don't speak English and those who are hard of hearing, and
also will make your video less opaque for search technologies when we
add support for that.

Again, I really apologize for it taking this long to post them. I hope
to have faster turn-around on future conferences.

Questions, comments, concerns--just let me know.
