If you're one of the lucky people going to PyCon 2010, you might want to
spend some time coming up to speed on some of the talks being given.

**Interested in the GIL?** David Beazley is `giving a
talk <http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/76/>`__ on the
inner workings of the Python GIL. He's given several GIL-related
presentations before: `Asynchronous vs. Threaded
Python <http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/1100/asynchronous-vs-threaded-pytho>`__,
`Mindblowing Python
GIL <http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/1101/mindblowing-python-gil>`__,
and `Changes to the GIL in Python
3 <http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/1226/changes-to-the-gil-in-python-3>`__.

**Interested in documentation?** Wesleay J. Chun is `giving a
talk <http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/P40/>`__ on
writing books using Python and Open Source Software. This will likely
talk about `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`__. Take some time to
watch `Brandon Rhodes talk about Sphinx at
PyAtl <http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/1243/the-sphinx-documentation-syste>`__.

**Interested in PyPy?** Maciej Fijalkowski is `giving a
talk <http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/schedule/event/P83/>`__ on the
speed of PyPy. Take some time to watch the `PyPy status
talk <http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/973/pypy-status-talk>`__
from PyCon 2009.

Don't go to PyCon unprepared!
