What is pyvideo.org
===================

`pyvideo.org <http://pyvideo.org/>`_ is an index
of Python-related videos on the Internet.  For the most part, it's a
collection of videos from Python-related conferences.  Saw a session you
liked and want to share it?  It's likely you can find it, watch it, and
share it with pyvideo.org.


PyCon US 2012 status
====================

Just got back from PyCon US 2012. It was really great conference this year.
If you weren't there, video from the conference is being posted to YouTube
and indexed at `pyvideo.org <http://pyvideo.org/>`_.

There were a lot of really great sessions. Here are ones I liked and/or were
really proud of.

1. Stormy's keynote:

2. GNU MediaGoblin poster session:

3. Erik Rose's Speedily Practical Large Scale Tests:

4. Jess and Asheesh's Diversity in Practice:

5. Karen's Improving Documentation With "Beginners Mind":

There are lots of others, now that I'm skimming through the list.

I reindexed the site just now, so search should work for PyCon US 2012 videos
again (thank you Stormy for the heads-up!). Carl's still posting things, so
it's possible if something that you're looking for isn't there now, it'll
show up soon. Also, all these videos are wrapped in Universal Subtitles
widgets---if you have some spare time and wanted to tackle a video, that'd be
awesome!

If you find problems with the site (it's not hard--they're everywhere), send me
email and let me know.


The plan
========

I just got home and I need to catch up with work. My immediate plan is to
fix the software and deployment scripts so I don't `epically screw up the site
<http://pyvideo.org/news/entry/6/pycon-2012-urls-are-all-different-sorry>`_
again. (I'm really sorry about that.)

After that, I want to implement feeds---that's a much requested feature (and
for good reason).

After that, I'll be fixing the myriad of other issues with the software and
the site. I'm tracking issues in the
`pmc issue tracker <http://github.com/willkg/pmc/issues/>`_ and the
`richard issue tracker <http://github.com/willkg/richard/issues/>`_ ("pmc"
stands for Python Miro Community and is the github repository I've been using
for the site for a while now---now it covers pyvideo.org stuff---and "richard"
is the software that runs pyvideo.org).
