Last week I got back from PyCon 2011 and it was flabbergastingly
awesome. This was the first PyCon I'd ever been able to go to. In
previous years, I just read blog posts and watched session videos
online.

Now that I've been, I realize how little of the conference is captured
in blog posts and session videos. Honestly, Doug and others are right
and the talks are maybe 1/5 of the conference if that. There's also:

* tutorials
* sprints that allow for in-person group collaboration
* giving lightning talks about things that are important to you to an
  interested audience of 800+
* talking with people whose code you use
* talking with people who use your code
* talking with people who work on libraries that solve the same
  problems but in different ways
* poster sessions
* the expo hall where a bunch of companies were hiring and a bunch of
  groups are showing off what they're doing
* talking with people about non-Python things
* free t-shirts, mugs, stickers, and bottle openers (which turned out
  to be very handy)!
* looking over peoples' shoulders and watching them use tools you've
  never heard of
* meeting other people who also wrote a mocking library, micro web
  framework, blogging system, or enum library (which covers at least
  half the attendees)
* ...

Being part of the video crew, there was some talk about how videoing the
conference sessions reduces the number of people who go. Honestly, if
you don't go to PyCon because you think you get the same experience from
watching the videos that get posted online, you're horribly mistaken.

I thought of some analogies to help understand:

* It's like seeing a 4x6 picture of a peach pie vs. having a slice
  sitting in front of you that was just taken out of the oven and it's
  got a nice honkin scoope of vanilla ice cream that's melting as you
  watch.
* It's like hearing a 15 second muzak-like ring tone of your favorite
  song vs. listening to it being played live at a concert.
* It's like looking at a JPEG image saved with a quality of 10% of your
  birthday party vs. being there. (You wouldn't skip your own birthday
  party, would you?)

I don't want to belabor the point beyond that. There are other reasons
people don't go to PyCon that are perfectly valid. Not going because the
conference sessions are posted online and that's equivalent to going to
the conference is not one of them. I hadn't gone previously because of
money, classes, work and family issues. I regret it now.

While at PyCon, I was on the video crew and ran the camera in room 5 on
Friday and Saturday. When I wasn't running the camera, I was watching
Carl, Ryan, Dave and others coordinate the video-recording side of the
conference. The amount of work, technology, and calamity-preventing
know-how that goes into videoing a conference is awe-inspiring. Carl
even took a moment to teach me how to coil cables correctly.

The `Next Day Video <http://nextdayvideo.com/>`__ crew have all the
videos currently posted on
`http://pycon.blip.tv/ <http://pycon.blip.tv>`__. They're working on
encoding them in Ogg Theora so that I can post them on `Python Miro
Community <http://python.mirocommunity.org/>`__ with the `Universal
Subtitles <http://universalsubtitles.org/>`__ embed code making it
possible to caption and translate these videos. We've already worked out
the workflow, so it's just a matter of finishing up encoding and posting
them.

`Carl and I gave a lightning
talk <http://python.mirocommunity.org/video/4120/pycon-2011-python-miro-communi>`__
about melding Python Miro Community with Universal Subtitles. I'm really
excited about this work. It makes these videos more accessible which is
really important. This work is funded by a grant from the PSF. (Thank
you!)

PyCon 2011 was amazing and I met a lot of amazing people, ate some great
food, participated in some great conversations, ...--it's hard not to
slide into absurd amounts of rampant hyperbole when talking about it.

Thank you so much to all the people who made this possible. PyCon is a
fantastic conference that's about people, building relationships,
enabling conversations, and reinforcing the community and the work you
put into it really shows.

I feel the need for the obligatory *I'm \*passionate\* about PyCon*.
