PyCon 2010 is over and the PyCon AV crew is working on taking the video
they've recorded, editing it, and posting it. As they post it to the
`Pycon blip.tv feed <http://pycon.blip.tv/>`__, I'm pulling it into
`Python Miro Community <http://python.mirocommunity.org/>`__. You can
keep track of my status
`here <http://python.mirocommunity.org/category/pycon2010>`__
(`RSS <http://python.mirocommunity.org/feeds/category/pycon2010>`__).

I sent an email to the Cambridge Python Meetup (Cambridge, MA, USA)
asking if they still record video and if so, where it gets posted.

Nate Aune sent me a link to the PloneTV feed. I'm in the process of
pulling those videos in.

One thing I've noticed while curating Python Miro Community is that the
quality of the image and audio make a *huge* difference in the
usefulness of the video after the event. It's a *huge* project with a
lot of finicky bits to reliably create great video.

Many many props to Carl Karsten, the PyCon-AV team, and all the other
people out there doing this work. It allows these presentations to live
beyond a moment in time and reach a much larger audience.
