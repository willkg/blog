A couple of weeks ago at Carl's urging, I applied for a grant from the
Python Software Foundation. This would cover Miro Community service
costs for the next year as well as work on a series of improvements to
the site. Things like:

* `Universal Subtitles support <http://universalsubtitles.org/>`__
* using transcriptions in the search corpus for videos
* implementing an API in Miro Community allowing for automated data
  validation

I talked about all this at length in my `call for
funding <http://bluesock.org/~willkg/blog/pmc/call_for_funding_2011.html>`__.

I'm very pleased to announce that the PSF has awarded me a grant. I know
how selective they are in their grant approval and I really appreciate
this. It helps me a ton and I will work hard to make it money well
spent.

I'll be at PyCon 2011.. I hope to spend some time with Carl, Asheesh and
others working on Miro Community. I'm also hoping to talk with people
who've used the site and what kinds of things we can make better going
forward. If you see me, feel free to say, "Hi!"
