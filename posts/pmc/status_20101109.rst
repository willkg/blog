In my :doc:`status report on November
1st <status_20101101>`, I
reported that I had written a script to fix invalid download links.
Turns out my script doesn't work as well as I had hoped. For example, I
only fixed 30 of the 120 or so PyCon 2010 videos. I'm working on fixing
it so that I can more programatically work through all the videos on
`Python Miro Community <http://python.mirocommunity.org/>`__ and update
download links.

I'm really sorry about this. Not having working download links and
podcast feeds sucks.
