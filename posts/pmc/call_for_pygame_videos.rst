I was going through the videos tweaking tags and other metadata when I
noticed that `Python Miro
Community <http://python.mirocommunity.org/>`__ has no videos that cover
`pygame <http://www.pygame.org/news.html>`__.

pygame is a library for writing games. It has a huge community and it's
a great way to introduce people to Python programming. I'd love to see
some pygame material on the site.

If you know of video tutorials for pygame that could be added to the
site, please submit them.

If you'd be interested in creating a video tutorial for pygame, let me
know and we can work on it.
