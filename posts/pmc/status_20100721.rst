This is the July status report for `Python Miro
Community <http://python.mirocommunity.org>`__. This site indexes videos
from around the Internet related to Python. In particular, we focus on
indexing conference session video and videos from our more prolific
Python user groups.

In the last month, we've finished approving all the `PyCon
2010 <http://us.pycon.org/2010/about/>`__ videos. They're all in the
`PyCon 2010 conference
category <http://python.mirocommunity.org/category/pycon2010>`__.

I spent a few hours adding metadata to and approving videos from `PyCon
AU 2010 <http://pycon-au.org/2010/about/>`__. There are some really
great ones--definitely worth looking at. They're all in the `PyCon AU
2010 conference
category <http://python.mirocommunity.org/category/pycon-au-2010>`__.

`PCF <http://pculture.org/>`__ released a new version of `Miro
Community <http://mirocommunity.org/>`__ with some bug fixes and a
widget that allows you to embed videos on other sites. I haven't played
with that yet, but it sounds useful.

I'm still working on recategorizing things per Carl's suggestions from
last month.

That's it for this status report. Any thoughts, questions or
concerns--let me know.
