The `GNU MediaGoblin <http://mediagoblin.org/>`_ project is raising
funds to allow Chris Webber to work on it full time for the next
year. The project has done really well over the last year and a half
and has come a long way. However, there's a bunch of work that needs
to be done and the sooner it gets done, the better. Essentially, we're
staring at a chasm between "bootstrapping the project" where we needed
enough to grow a community and have something people can build on and
"1.0" where it's generally usable by our target audience.

Because of that, Chris quit his job at Creative Commons to work on
MediaGoblin full time in a valiant attempt to get us across that
chasm.

There are a lot more details on `the MediaGoblin campaign page
<http://mediagoblin.org/pages/campaign.html>`_ and a movie that Chris
and Deb put together that explain why and why now.
