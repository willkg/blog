`MediaGoblin <http://mediagoblin.org/>`_ is currently running a
`fund-raising campaign <http://mediagoblin.org/pages/campaign.html>`_
to raise funds for Chris to work on MediaGoblin for the next year
implementing federation, making it easier to install and use, and
other features as well.

We just announced that `the next 25 people who donate $$200.00 or more
will get a chance to get free tickets to PyCon
<http://mediagoblin.org/news/campaign-pycon-giveaway.html>`_.

That's pretty awesome!

If you've been waiting to support MediaGoblin, `now's the time to do
it <http://mediagoblin.org/pages/campaign.html>`_!
