I was using telnet to connect to this mud I play on and I got tired of
telnet. So I started looking around for solid mudclients and found a
few--but they were either buggy or bloated or shareware or any number of
a myriad of bad things. I decide to roll my own and do it in Python.
Then I discover Lyntin--this mudclient written in Python and the
maintainer hadn't touched it in months. He hands over the maintenance of
the project to me. I move it to Sourceforge, put out a few versions, fix
a few bugs, and voilla! I have a solid mudclient.

Then I start releasing versions with the fixes in it. And people around
the world email me on occasion--I get like 1 or 2 emails a week. Some of
them have patches for things that are broken. Some of them have feature
requests. One of them said he didn't like Lyntin at all. But all of them
were "Thanks--great job!"

That's so cool.
