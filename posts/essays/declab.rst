I spent a lot of time in the computer science lab at Boston College.

Let me rephrase that. I spent a \_lot\_ of time in the DEClab. I used to
sleep in the DEClab semi-regularly. I worked there, played there,
socialized there (yes, I know...), and occasionally did other stuff
there.

I have a lot of fond memories of that time and the people I spent the
time with. Too many to write here. In the declab, someone once wrote on
the white board "My karma ran over my dogma."

That pretty much sums up my long stay in the DEClab.
