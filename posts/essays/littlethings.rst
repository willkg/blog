I found out that when my mom went to italy, she used bluemail to check
her mail--she thought it was great. MY MOM USED BLUEMAIL! How fun is
that? My mother thought it was a real program, too--she didn't pick up
on the fact that a) it's missing a *lot* of functionality, and b) it
was written by me!

So she's like "oh, and I used Bluemail--it was great!" And I said,
"yeah, I implemented forwarding and reply-all a few months ago and no
one's really touch it since then." And then she goes, "what? you wrote
that? wow...."

YES!
