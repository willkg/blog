There has been a long list of things that have moved me. Like when
you're playing harmonics on a guitar, the other notes vibrate in
sympathy. While I don't recall why I originally added this topic to my
on stuff list, it's one of those topics that's easy to come up with one
or two things on the spur of the moment--and then spend the rest of your
life thinking about.

I think the things that move me the most tend to be sudden and
unexpected and usually while I'm busy trying to get something done.
Rarely do I find things that move me while I'm sitting still enjoying
the placitudes. Sometimes it's a connection. A sudden realization of an
isomorphic mapping of a group of things that allow me some insight as to
the relation of the items in the group. Course, I'm talking about items
in the non-thing sense--they could just as easily be feelings or
thoughts or visual abstractions.

Maybe someday I'll reach a point where it's important to make a list of
the things that have moved me. Partly because I require moving again, or
maybe because the list will move me and bring insight as to the things
that move me. I guess, kind of a meta-moving.

**Updates:**

12/9/2004: Everyone has stuff that moves them, so I'm not
really sure how interesting this "essay" is. I think it's a good idea
to add some data points.

I was really moved the first time I saw Eternal Sunshine of the
Spotless Mind but not that moved the second time I saw it.

I was really moved when my dad told me he really admired the fact
that I'm working on getting into grad school. I definitely don't have
a good feel for why, but I was moved that he felt it important enough
to send me an email about it.

I was moved when in January of 2004 (or maybe February--I forget
specifically), my grandmother called me on the phone to tell me
goodbye forever (she was really sick with cancer and a dozen or so
other issues) and that she always cherished the moments we spent
together and thought that I was a really good person. Then she died a
few days later.

There are more but this is good enough.
