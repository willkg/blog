The United States Post Office increases the cost of postage periodically.
They do faster than I use the stamps that I've bought.  In the process
of this, I ended up with first class stamps that have no value listed on
them, so I had no idea how much they were worth.

Buried on the USPS web-site is `this quick service guide <http://pe.usps.gov/text/qsg300/Q604a.htm>`_
that lists the values of all stamps that have no
value listed on them.
