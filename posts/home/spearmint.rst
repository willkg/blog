S and I bought a spearmint plant on Sunday and I repotted the plant
(it had outgrown the pot they sold it to us in) and clipped off all the
leaves that were either dead or in the process of dying.

Depending on how well we do with spearmint (which is really hearty and
grows like a weed [and I may join the spearmint with some mint from
my grandfather's house]), we may try growing our own basil.  If the
basil works as well, we may move on to other herbs!
