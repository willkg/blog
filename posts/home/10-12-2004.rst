The spearmint plant is doing fine. I think I'm going to move it next year to a
place on our porch that's not in direct sunlight for most of the day.  Seems as
though the plant and soil dry out too fast when I do that.  If I can clean
enough of the stuff in the study out, I'll put the plant in there.

I snipped some of the branches off and dried the leaves. I think I have enough
spearmint for a couple of cups of tea now. Next year, I'll be more aggressive
about clipping and drying.

Other than tea, I can't think of any good uses for mint. We might add another
plant next year that's more useful. Probably basil.
