The article I wrote for GNOME Journal about GNOME Miro Community went
live yesterday.  You can read
it `here <http://gnomejournal.org/article/92/gnome-miro-community>`_.
It's a great introduction to why I created GNOME Miro Community, what
can be done with it, and how you can help.  Many thanks to Sumana and
Paul for their help with getting it published!

While working on that article and the screenshot, I fixed a few
templates and some of the CSS (with the help of Parker from 
`OpenHatch <http://openhatch.org/>`_).  There should be RSS feed
links on all of the listing pages now.  Additionally, I did a pass through
all the videos and removed ones that have disappeared.

Sumana pointed out that in order to submit a video to the site, you had
to be logged in.  That was a mistake--I really apologize.  In order
for this site to be useful to as many people as possible, it's important
not to have barriers to video submission like that.  If you balked at
having to sign in while submitting a video, please try again.

There are two kinds of videos I'm really interested in adding to the
site:

* up-to-date videos showing GNOME Shell, GNOME Activity Journal, and
  Zeitgeist that show new functionality added recently and specify which
  version is being demonstrated,
* howto, tutorial and screencast videos for important things that need
  more of a spotlight; for example, accessibility

If you have anything that fills these needs, submit a video or send me
an email!
