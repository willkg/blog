A little over a week ago, I started 
`GNOME Miro Community <http://gnome.mirocommunity.org/>`_.  I'm a
Miro developer and we use a ton of Gnome stuff in the application.
The site will index Gnome related videos from around the Internet.  I hope
it'll aid Gnome development.  

I started a few categories: 
`gnome-shell <http://gnome.mirocommunity.org/category/gnome-shell>`_,
`gstreamer <http://gnome.mirocommunity.org/category/gstreamer>`_,
and `GUADEC 2009 <http://gnome.mirocommunity.org/category/guadec2009>`_.
I'll be adding to these going forward.

One of the big things that I did was to bulk load the GUADEC 2009 videos
into Gnome MC.  I built an RSS feed, populated it with descriptions of the
talks from the `Gran Canaria Desktop Summit <http://www.grancanariadesktopsummit.org/>`_
wiki pages, and pulled it all into Gnome MC.  Today I pulled
down the videos and generated thumbnails for everything and pushed that
up, too.  Took about 5 hours in total, but the data is much more useful now.

Gnome MC will do searches every night for new material out there.  I'll keep
tabs on this queue.  If you know of videos that haven't been added either
let me know or submit them through the site.

I'm really excited about this site and I'll do my best to keep it going and
make it as useful as possible.  I hope it helps to make Gnome as awesome
as it can be!
