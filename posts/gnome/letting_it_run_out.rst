A couple of years ago I applied and was granted membership into the
GNOME Foundation. At the time, I was helping out with GNOME Journal
and running GNOME Miro Community.

Since then, GNOME Miro Community fizzled out and stopped because it didn't
find a compelling reason to exist (wasn't interesting for marketing, didn't
do a good job of indexing conference video, ...). GNOME Journal fizzled
too and I stopped working on it.

Also, in September, I left PCF where I was working on Miro which uses a lot
of GNOME technologies.

Given that, I decided not to renew my membership. I'm a little bummed, but
I'm not doing anything. I do wish them well. I will miss the periodic
anti-FSF fireworks.
